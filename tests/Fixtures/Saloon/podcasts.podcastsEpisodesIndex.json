Today I'm going to talk to you about the creator economy and a tonal shift that I've noticed within it. Before I get to that, let me share a few building public updates around my software as a service project. Now, Podline, Podline.fm, my voice messaging thing for podcasters is slowly getting users. I get a couple signups every now and then, but it's not seeing much use. It's probably because I've done zero marketing outside of the founder space while I'm building this in public.\\n[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:39.200]   Where I'm sharing all the updates, just like this one with my fellow founders. And that space, the founder space is quite distinct from the high profile podcast that I want to reach.\\n[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.200]   My Podline is meant to help very established, quite popular podcast to reach the audience. There is some overlap in the indie hacker space.\\n[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:57.720]   I think there are several podcasts there where the founders have built quite the audience, but it's not my main target for an audience, right, for a customer base.\\n[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:07.160]   So that is one of those cases where building a public is kind of two-sided. One is the backend side, it's the business side, and the other side is the customer facing front-end side.\\n[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:17.840]   And I haven't done much work there. And that's kind of why I started building this other tool that I'm also kind of building and public and sharing a lot of information about this podcast scanning application.\\n[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:29.840]   And I can now announce that this actually has a name because I registered a domain and put like a blanket marketing page on there. It's called PotScan.fm because I want it to be a scanner for podcasts.\\n[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:42.560]   It's pretty simple. That's the current working progress title for the thing. And let me share with you a couple of challenges along the way over the last week or so of building a tool that supposedly scans all podcasts everywhere for keywords.\\n[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:54.560]   That's the idea, right? It's effective via Google alerts for your brand or whatever thing you want to look into your competitors or whatever in all podcasts, English-speaking podcasts that are released all the time.\\n[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:06.080]   And this takes quite some backend configuration. It takes quite some architecture in the backend. I did not expect this initially because my initial thought was how hard can it be, you know, in the hacker style.\\n[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   But I figured like transcribing a lot of podcasts at the same time takes some architecture to build. And for that, I needed to look into GPU architecture.\\n[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:29.080]   It's not just servers where you have a database and some processing and some files being thrown around. You actually need a lot of computational power on a graphics processor, like a vector-based computational stuff.\\n[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   This is most of the AI things that I integrate into this. It's not machine learning, per se, but it's like transcription based on an LM called Whisper that open AI released for free.\\n[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   A lot of that optimally happens on a GPU. It's just so much faster than anything that is thrown at CPU, even though there are versions of the system going to get to this in a second.\\n[00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   But GPU is what you need. And to be able to run a VM on AWS or Google Cloud or other services like Vulture, you need to be verified because there's so much abuse in this space.\\n[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   And I did not expect this when I went into building AI-based tools. There's so much like Bitcoin mining that people do and really, really intrusive things that they don't pay, right?\\n[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   They put some fake credit card in there. They mine for a month and they don't pay the actual fee. That happens a lot, which is why AWS and every other provider that offers virtual machines, instances with their GPU attached, have a pretty rigorous verification process that is part of this.\\n[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   And I fell into this. Now, fortunately, I have some sway, I guess. I have my Twitter audience that I've built over years now that is sizable, and among which are some people who work for companies that can help me back channel these things.\\n[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   Or I just have a following that is big enough for the media people at this company to figure this out.\\n[00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   So this has been a really, really useful thing, my audience, just to get these things kind of sped up a little bit escalated, which is, I guess, an indictment of the system as it stands, or it's quite bureaucratic.\\n[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   And only if you have a side channel, can you actually get through it? But, yeah, verification. That's a big thing.\\n[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   If you want to just quickly ramp something up, you better expect there to be a couple of things thrown in your path, and the verification is one of them.\\n[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.080]   It's not too hard, right? All I needed to do to verify these things is to point to my public communication about the project, just to show them that it's real.\\n[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   Because what they don't want are people who fake things and then get going, right? You know, then start mining or start not paying the bills.\\n[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   So that's something I fell into. AWS vultures another service that I found that I actually have already been verified at. I'm still working through my AWS certification or verification at this point as we speak.\\n[00:04:48.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   That might be done in a couple days, but who knows? Vulture, I got credit, so I can now rent a CPU unit, which is going to cost me like $300 a month, just for one GPU based VM, which is quite some money.\\n[00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:32.590]   I'm going to get in a second to how many of them I actually need to parse all podcasts everywhere, but let me just talk about one other thing that I also needed to be verified for, which was paddle, like payment provider. Usually I go with Stripe with these kind of things, but for this service, as I'm turning it into a business besides Podline, my Podline and Pod scan are both going to be businesses that I run because they're just so adjacent in terms of what they do technologically. And because I can use one for the other as a kind of dog.\\n[00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.630]   The paddle integration that I have always hoped for finally landed this month, and that is the\\n[00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.950]   level spark integration level, the framework that I use for these projects has these kind of tools in\\n[00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.150]   the ecosystem and Spark is their payment provider integration. It used to be a thing that only supported\\n[00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.630]   Stripe. You could install Spark to pay product, I think it's $99 one-time fee for a single project\\n[00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.470]   or $250 for however many projects you want forever, which is kind of cool. That just integrates those\\n[00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.830]   payment providers really reliably into your product. You just install it once in a require\\n[00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.910]   command and then it immediately pulls everything together. It puts the database tables and it connects\\n[00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.030]   to your Stripe account. If you put the credentials and it synchronizes all the customers' emails\\n[00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.030]   and names and it puts the products in there if you need it, then it's really cool. It's a really useful\\n[00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.230]   tool to not have to build yourself. And I certainly don't want to touch anything that touches money.\\n[00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.670]   I want this to be something that other people who are better coders and more versed in these kind\\n[00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.830]   of APIs than me do for me, which is why I pay for software. It's very simple. Other people write\\n[00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.630]   better software than I do and I pay for this. And finally, they support paddle, which is important\\n[00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.270]   because paddle is a merchant of record where Stripe is just a payment gateway. So with Stripe,\\n[00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.270]   you have to deal with all the taxes and that stuff yourself. They make it a bit easier than\\n[00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.550]   it used to be, but paddle is a platform that effectively sells your subscriptions for you.\\n[00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:10.590]   So if I use paddle, I don't have to deal with Texas at all. I get what they call a reverse invoice\\n[00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:17.070]   where they sell products on my behalf and most of that money percentage-wise, I kind of invoice\\n[00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.270]   them or they invoice themselves for me and send it to me. That's kind of what the reverse thing is.\\n[00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.070]   So it's really, really useful because that effectively means that however many customers I have,\\n[00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:33.790]   I have 12 invoices a year. And for tax purposes, for a sort of perner, that makes a huge lot of\\n[00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.670]   difference. I don't have to deal with taxes and I only have 12 documents that I need to file.\\n[00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:44.750]   Obviously, I have more expenses and all that, but compared to Stripe, where for each customer that I\\n[00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.390]   have, however many transactions I have with them in a year, that's the number of invoices I have\\n[00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.910]   per customer and then I have a thousand customers. So I have 12,000 invoices that becomes complicated,\\n[00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.710]   paddle makes it a bit easier. I'm a fan of both platforms. Stripe makes it super easy, paddle a\\n[00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.750]   bit less because they have a verification process because as they sell your product,\\n[00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:10.590]   they better make sure they sell a thing that they can sell should legally are allowed to sell\\n[00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:16.110]   and feel comfortable selling. And when I put my name in the new account there and I put my\\n[00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.590]   bootstrapfounder.com domain, right? I have my blog list just because I didn't have a domain\\n[00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.550]   for PontScan yet. They declined it. They said, no, your blog, like you're selling consulting\\n[00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:31.710]   services and you have a store with like merch, which we will not sell, like physical products,\\n[00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:39.470]   we do not do. All we do as paddle is like e-commerce stuff that is purely digital or SaaS or, you know,\\n[00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:44.590]   that those kinds of things, never ever consulting and never ever physical products. And I was like,\\n[00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.230]   all right, I guess for this purpose, I need to put up a marketing page, which I then did.\\n[00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.830]   So PotScan.fm is the marketing page. I think it's it's the product life, but it's not really running\\n[00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:00.670]   just yet. So if you sign up, if you want to, there's not going to be anything there. I will launch it\\n[00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.230]   in due time. You can probably get an account there or whatever, but that wouldn't make much sense\\n[00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.710]   because the backend is it's in development, right? That's what it is. You're going to see a product\\n[00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:16.830]   that is highly in development. I will keep registrations active just to see what happens, but I don't\\n[00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.230]   expect people to use it as it's not usable at this point. I'm still working on it locally as a\\n[00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:27.150]   development tool as I'm figuring out the whole scanning and transcribing podcasts and the cloud\\n[00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.390]   thing, which is the next thing that I want to talk to you about because I was experimenting with\\n[00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:37.070]   GPU and CPU transcription, which for anybody who wants to do AI things is pretty important, right?\\n[00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:43.070]   If you and your next business has some kind of AI component and you don't want to just pay open AI\\n[00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:49.950]   for every single thing that you sent their way, look into if you can run this locally or on a VM\\n[00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:56.990]   instance that has the proper hardware. Sometimes these things can be run almost without an issue\\n[00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.710]   just on a CPU. On a computer that doesn't even have a graphics card, you can still run\\n[00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.230]   large language models or transcription models such as Whisper. It's\\n[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.180]   It's just gonna be a bit slow, but if you don't need much of it, it's perfectly fine.\\n[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.600]   But I do need much of it, I did some napkin math.\\n[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.120]   There's this rough number in my case of English speaking episodes of podcasts that are released\\n[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.640]   in any given day.\\n[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.280]   It's probably around 10,000.\\n[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.440]   Might be more depending on what kind of podcasts you look into.\\n[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.740]   There are certain podcasts out there that I wouldn't even think qualify for me looking\\n[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.980]   for keywords in them, things like the daily religious prayers that are just repeated the\\n[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.580]   same thing every single day with a little bit of radiation, not sure if I even need to\\n[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.580]   scan these.\\n[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.180]   But let's just say there's 10,000 episodes a day.\\n[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.060]   And I went through my database over the last couple of days, I just pulled every single\\n[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.580]   podcast I could and just started transcribing them.\\n[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.960]   On average, they are like 50 minutes in length, which is quite high, but that's the average\\n[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.060]   that I have.\\n[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:06.580]   So that means if you do some math, that's kind of 50,000 or let's just say 48,000 to make\\n[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.540]   it easier to round down and stuff.\\n[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:15.660]   48,000 minutes in a day, in 24 hours, that's 2,000 minutes per hour, divide both by 60,\\n[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:25.500]   I guess, to get seconds per minute is 2,000 seconds, oh, sorry, not seconds per minute,\\n[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:32.300]   but seconds per second is 2,000 seconds of spoken word per second, okay, I guess like\\n[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.700]   the math is kind of in that realm, right?\\n[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:42.500]   So my GPU, my M1 on my laptop or not my laptop, my Mac studio does 120 of seconds of audio\\n[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.180]   transcription per second, right, just two minutes of audio I can transcribe per second,\\n[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.460]   which is quite fast because it's on a GPU and it's accelerated using open-air whispers\\n[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.060]   base model, which is super fast and still quite accurate, accurate.\\n[00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:03.140]   So to get to 2,000 seconds of spoken words per second, I need 16 of these M1 Macs, which\\n[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.780]   obviously I don't have.\\n[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.420]   And I don't really want to pay for 16 VMs in the cloud because they're quite expensive.\\n[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:17.940]   I checked a cloud vulture GPU instance is $300 and to have 16 of those means that I would\\n[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.660]   pay, well, you know, a lot of money, it's like 40, 48 hundreds, like for almost $5,000\\n[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.180]   a month, which is still crazy to think that that's the ceiling to scan all podcasts everywhere,\\n[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.180]   right?\\n[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.860]   English speaking podcasts that you just need $5,000 a month and expenses in GPUs.\\n[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.140]   And that is all you need to deal with the incoming stream of audio.\\n[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.860]   What I will do is to whittle down the numbers of things that I actually need to scan.\\n[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:50.820]   I already started, I built a transcription checker, fortunately, and I learned this through the\\n[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.620]   wonderful work that Justin Jackson and John Buddha are doing at Transistor FM, I looked\\n[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.300]   into the RSS feeds that that platform provides, which this podcast is on.\\n[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.820]   So literally I looked at my own podcast feed, the RSS feed for this, and I found a namespace\\n[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   in there.\\n[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.820]   And that's the podcasting namespace.\\n[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:12.620]   It's kind of an XML or an atom namespace that defines a few things that podcasts can\\n[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.740]   reliably put into their RSS feed and that they have information.\\n[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.500]   It's like, who's the host of the show, that kind of stuff?\\n[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.980]   And also, is there a transcript for this show?\\n[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.500]   And what format does it have and where does it live?\\n[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   That is really cool.\\n[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:30.580]   So I'm now checking the RSS feeds of the podcasts I ingest for POD scan if there is\\n[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.580]   a transcript and if there is a transcript, instead of downloading the audio and transcribing\\n[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.300]   it myself, I'm using the transcript.\\n[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.780]   Now that's not too many of these.\\n[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.420]   Not too many podcasts actually offer transcripts, unfortunately, but it's already cutting down\\n[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.340]   on a transcription time that I do and need to do.\\n[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.340]   The next thing I'm probably going to do is to be very careful about what category podcasts\\n[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.780]   I actually ingest and to skip ones that are just way too long.\\n[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.060]   You know, those kind of shows hardcore history was like an eight hour podcast episode.\\n[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.060]   I'm not going to transcribe this.\\n[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.860]   I'm at least not at this point.\\n[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:11.940]   Right now, I'm building a tool, a keyword checking tool for regular podcasts, not series, not\\n[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.420]   anything kind of cinematic, right, but regular shows where people talk about stuff and where\\n[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.940]   people who want to do marketing in podcasts through podcasts and with podcasts can find\\n[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.580]   mentions of terms and phrases that they care about.\\n[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:29.020]   And for that, I will limit myself to shows that are shorter or that are more regular than\\n[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.980]   these kind of episodical things.\\n[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:36.300]   I will also probably drop certain categories altogether like the daily prayer category\\n[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.740]   or I'm not sure what else I'm going to have to look into this going to get back to you\\n[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.340]   on this in a week or two just going to try and figure out how I can reduce the number\\n[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.260]   of podcasts that come into the system so I can reliably ignore a few of them at least\\n[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.820]   in the beginning stages where I don't have 5k MRR yet to pay for this because the moment\\n[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.420]   I can scan every podcast everywhere reliably and financially, you know, with the revenue\\n[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.980]   that I make, then I will, but for now, I'm going to check what needs to be the highest\\n[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.860]   effort or what the lowest effort for the highest reward would be, right?\\n[00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:14.010]   is just kind of what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to be physically responsible and just scrappy at this point.\\n[00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:25.010]   So next up, I will skim the number of things that I ingest and I'm going to rework my whole transcription server backend because I thought, \\\"How am I going to build this?\\n[00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.010]   It's all on one machine right now.\\n[00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:35.010]   I'm going to pull it all apart and turn it into a queue system that I can just dive into from backend systems, however many I built.\\n[00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:43.010]   However many clones of the API transcription server I built, they will all go and fetch things from a central queue, work on it, and return it.\\n[00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.010]   That's the idea. So I'm still thinking about this. So that's my next step.\\n[00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:59.010]   And beyond that, outside of my SAS efforts, I'm also preparing my talk on Daniel Vassalo's Small Bets community at the end of February, I think the last day of February, about building a media business.\\n[00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:09.010]   That brings me to the topic that I really want to talk to you about today because in looking at that media business landscape, I had a thought.\\n[00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:16.010]   And that thought is, or was, is the creator economy as it is now a misnomer?\\n[00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.010]   Are we misnaming the creator economy?\\n[00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:28.010]   Because when I think about creators and the effort and time that they spent on their work, it very much seems familiar to a 9 to 5 job at this point.\\n[00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:37.010]   There are a lot of people on YouTube in particular in the visual creator space that are stopping right now because they cannot deal with the daily grind anymore.\\n[00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.010]   And it's really what it is for most people, daily grind.\\n[00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:51.010]   Its main focus at this point is just to retain the attention of the people that are watching, or retain the attention of your readers, or whoever it is, you want to keep people engaged.\\n[00:16:51.010 --> 00:17:03.010]   And without this attention, creators have very little because all the monetization things around creator businesses, they work on that number on how many people are actively engaged.\\n[00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.010]   If you have a newsletter, how many readers do you have?\\n[00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.010]   What's the open rate?\\n[00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.010]   How much to click rate?\\n[00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.010]   You need active engagement as a creator.\\n[00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.010]   It's not something that can hum along.\\n[00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.010]   You need to make sure that it always is on.\\n[00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:20.010]   And an artist needs people to consume their work.\\n[00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.010]   Without attention, creators really have nothing there.\\n[00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:28.010]   Or to listen to music or read their books or whatever it is, you need people to actively do a thing.\\n[00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:32.010]   And you have to create something interesting to cater to your audience's attention.\\n[00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.010]   In a way, that's what a business is about, right?\\n[00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:40.010]   Serving people's desires with the products that they crave so that will compensate you for your work with money.\\n[00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.010]   But in the creator economy, you often need to grow before you can monetize.\\n[00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:52.010]   That's something that is very different from a bootstrap SaaS business, as I'm trying to build it right now with Podline and Podscan.\\n[00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:58.010]   The moment money is coming in, you start using this revenue to foster further growth.\\n[00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:04.010]   But as a creator, you have to get to this critical mass of traction and interest before you can even ask for money.\\n[00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:09.010]   One example here is YouTube's monetization system.\\n[00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:21.010]   On YouTube, you have to have at least a thousand followers or subscribers, and you have to have at least four hours of watched content in a month to be able to then monetize it.\\n[00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.010]   So you have to have a thousand people that are already interested in your work.\\n[00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.010]   So you have to put in all that effort to get to that point.\\n[00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:31.010]   And you have to convince them to watch a lot of your work 400 hours.\\n[00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:36.010]   It might even be 4,000 hours. It's the kind of changes over time YouTube has made a couple changes.\\n[00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.010]   I forgot how much it was for me, but it was a lot.\\n[00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:47.010]   And I was like, you have to put all of this work in for free to be able to make some money and you start with like making $1 a month or something.\\n[00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.010]   That's a lot.\\n[00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:54.010]   It's kind of similar to internships, where you just have to prove yourself before you're allowed to get a job.\\n[00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:58.010]   It's pretty weird. You can see this in the creator economy as well.\\n[00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:06.010]   It's just the rules of the systems that we work in are that you have to prove yourself first.\\n[00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:12.010]   Sponsors for newsletters aren't attracted until you have thousands of loyal readers and the same goes for podcasts like this one.\\n[00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.010]   This challenge is the cold start problem.\\n[00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:21.010]   How do you get those first followers if you need time to create content but also need money to sustain your life to be able to create it?\\n[00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:27.010]   So in a way, I think the term creator economy might be wishful thinking.\\n[00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.010]   What it truly is is the attention economy.\\n[00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:36.010]   And this isn't new advertising, which is kind of focusing attention has been playing with this concept for years.\\n[00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.010]   Attention is key. It's all about pay per click, not just pay per impression.\\n[00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:45.010]   If you look into how those systems monetize, there's an active intentional component that they monetize on.\\n[00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:51.010]   The click matters because it shows people's willingness to invest their time and their focus on what we create.\\n[00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:56.010]   So how can we find attention and how can we make it money for our work?\\n[00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.010]   Can we have it make money for our work?\\n[00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:04.010]   I think I'm lucky to have chosen a niche that's creators in the hackers and those who want to build something meaningful.\\n[00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.010]   My work isn't for people who just want a little side project.\\n[00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.010]   I think it is for people who want to build a business and a legacy.\\n[00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:21.680]   and focusing on this group has been a smart choice. It created alignment, a lot of alignment, because I know where people come from and I know where they want to go, and I can speak to this.\\n[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   And people see this in my work. They see this in how I communicate what phrases I use, what terms I use, and a lot of successful creators out there start by finding a loyal audience in their chosen space, and they don't try to cater to everybody around it.\\n[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   But they focus on those who share their interest and share the common language, and even when they change over time, they pivot very slowly and keeping their audience engaged at the same time, pulling them along or pulling a majority of that audience along.\\n[00:20:51.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   For example, as an amateur musician, and I'm really amateur, I play the accordion really badly, and I recently got a couple of synthesizers just to play and make some music.\\n[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   I follow many people on YouTube who make this music, who I can learn from. And I've seen careers change, which really interesting, very slowly over years, from gear reviewers into other fields.\\n[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   One example that I have there is a channel that I follow and forget the name, but it's just a guy who started out reviewing microphones and reviewing instruments and all that kind of stuff, just getting the newest instruments in and playing around with them and showing what they can do, and maybe doing it in a paid capacity as a sponsor thing with the company that made the instrument, or just doing it because they hope to, in their future, get sponsorships from companies like this.\\n[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   It was really noticeable that there was a business behind it, really interesting.\\n[00:21:43.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   But then they figured out, \\\"Hey, all my musical talent that I put into just showing how this keyboard works or whatnot, I could put into another kind of use and I could talk about what good songs are made of, what the structure is, how to make a song like this, where to find the samples, how to make a beat and all that kind of stuff.\\\"\\n[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   And you see these people slowly adding this content and just experimenting with it. It's really, really interesting.\\n[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   There was a video where the guy just talked about the song structure of a synthwave song and just explained it.\\n[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   And there was a video where they shared the best plugins to make that kind of music, and you could see in the comments them asking their audience, \\\"Is this something that's interesting to you?\\\"\\n[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   Or, \\\"What could I put into this to make it even more interesting?\\\" There was like active market research happening in the content that people created over time, very slowly, but they did create it over time.\\n[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:45.680]   And it's kind of, career change is an interesting phrase because in an economy like this, is this how it's supposed to work?\\n[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   I really wonder.\\n[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   But reviewing stuff is always an easy way to start, if you have an expertise in an area like Audio Gear, Electronics Photography, you see this a lot in these fields as well.\\n[00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   And then over time you get into bigger and more aspirational content that is still related to your original field.\\n[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   So that's how this works in terms of focusing.\\n[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.680]   We can focus on a specific audience first, provide valuable content for them.\\n[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   And then this will help you gain attention and allow you to grow, pivot, and then monetize your work.\\n[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   Over time, a lot of people stopped doing the thing they initially did and moved to something else.\\n[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   And that is perfectly fine.\\n[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:34.680]   It's fascinating to see because not only do they go into different topics, people also start building businesses from there in the creator economy.\\n[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   Again, maybe a misnomer, the attention, retention economy.\\n[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.680]   Maybe that's what it is.\\n[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   A lot of these musicians that I follow very actively start releasing little info products.\\n[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   They have their own plugins or they have settings for certain plugins that other people even produce.\\n[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   And they start selling these.\\n[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   You have this in music where you have sample packs, you have this in photography where you have lots, like the look up tables that people use to color,\\n[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   color great, the photos that they do, and a certain kind of color warmth or a certain style, like a vintage, whatever kind of color scheme you want.\\n[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   People sell these info products.\\n[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   It's a pretty interesting way of monetizing outside of the attention, right?\\n[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   Because as a YouTuber, you monetize pretty much through the attention that your videos get and the clicks and the ads that get played and all that if you focus exclusively on YouTube.\\n[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   If you have sponsors, people pay you for attention as well.\\n[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   But if you have a product to actually sell to people, that is a result of your expertise.\\n[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   All of a sudden, you kind of sidestep the necessity for this continued attention.\\n[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   A little bit.\\n[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   You still need people to come in and buy it.\\n[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   Obviously, see it and buy it.\\n[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   But you sell something else, but people's eyes on your content.\\n[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   Another thing is an important shift that is turning the creator, I only create and people pay me for what I create in terms of content.\\n[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   This is a holistic media business that has a creator side and it has a product side.\\n[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   I think it's a pretty viable idea to think about it as a more distinct.\\n[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:19.840]   kind of thing. So in the creative economy, you need a good reason for people to watch your work,\\n[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.320]   just because you think it's interesting. The thing you do, the thing you create doesn't mean that others\\n[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.960]   will think the same thing. Getting attention like this is super hard. And what I'm saying is that\\n[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.680]   being creative isn't enough in the creator economy. Creativity has to capture attention. So you have\\n[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.800]   to be creative at capturing attention. And if your creations resonate with your target audience,\\n[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.040]   then your creativity is effective in getting the attention needed to make money from your work.\\n[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.120]   So if you're starting as a creator, and this seems overwhelming to you, just don't worry at this\\n[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.720]   point. You can still build something great. Just make sure what you do is meaningful to a specific\\n[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:01.520]   group of people and you slowly move into new fields over time. Knowing who you're creating for at\\n[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:07.280]   any point in time helps your creativity shine. It attracts the right attention. If you're aware\\n[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.160]   of who you're doing it for and how. And finding ways to grab people's attention, that is the\\n[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.440]   challenge, right? You have to be creative in showing that you understand them. People usually\\n[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.720]   are drawn in when they feel a connection. They will have to think, \\\"This person gets us. They know\\n[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:28.080]   our struggles and how we think. I'll give them a chance.\\\" That's when you succeed. That's when you\\n[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.560]   get people's attention. When you earn people's attention, maybe more importantly, because you speak\\n[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.160]   the same language, you speak to the same aspirations, you have the same challenges.\\n[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.880]   That is what gets people to you. Being creative just for the sake of it might not be enough.\\n[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.440]   So don't expect to make money from it, because we live in an attention-driven world right now.\\n[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.160]   The creator economy needs attention to thrive, might as well be called the attention economy,\\n[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:59.200]   as it rightfully is by some people in marketing. But just understand that you have to find\\n[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.360]   connection with people. That's what I'm thinking about when I'm preparing these little\\n[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.840]   media business workshops. I want to make sure that the people who\\n[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.000]   start a business in the media space understand how the dynamics in your work.\\n[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.440]   Because you come from a technical background very likely, if you do it, like I do, you have no idea\\n[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:25.280]   how the psychodynamics of this field work. You think if I build something really, really valuable,\\n[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.920]   people will see it and they will allow me to find compensation, but that's not the case.\\n[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:36.080]   It is about actually building something valuable and mostly tricking people into finding it interesting.\\n[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.720]   And then actually getting their interest and helping them and making sure, oh yeah, that was\\n[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   actually a good choice to be tricked by this. It's quite bizarre. It's also the reason why we\\n[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:51.200]   have YouTube thumbnails that are just stupidly loud in the visual way. You have to trick a person\\n[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.880]   to come watch your video to figure out, oh yeah, that was actually quite useful.\\n[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.120]   If you don't trick them into looking at it, somebody else will trick them into looking at theirs.\\n[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.920]   So yeah, that's the attention economy in a nutshell. I think that's it for today.\\n[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.960]   I'm just going to briefly thank my sponsor right now at choir.com.\\n[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.200]   I recently talked to a founder who sold their business. Actually, the podcast episode is going\\n[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.600]   to land in a week. We dive into all of the whole sales process. It was really cool, 3.5 million\\n[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.480]   dollar sale. It's pretty substantial. And this conversation showed me just how important it is\\n[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.360]   to be aware of all the options that you have as a founder. Most of us want to build businesses\\n[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.280]   that keep putting money in our pockets forever. That's kind of the SaaS founder dream, I guess.\\n[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   We built this business that just keeps running and making you money. But entrepreneurship is hard\\n[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   and there are so many reasons why our original intentions change at some point, right? At whatever\\n[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.920]   happens, we're left with an asset that generates money. Sure. But if there's misalignment,\\n[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.520]   that will also create anxiety. And personally, I went through this quite intensely. I was mid-burnout\\n[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.480]   when I sold my business. And I'm glad I sold because it solved both my financial problems\\n[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.520]   and my mental health issues because I was rid of the thing that was causing me all this anxiety.\\n[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.800]   So if for any reason beyond mental health, but also including it, you feel like your current\\n[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.160]   business might turn from a profit engine into kind of an anxiety generator, start preparing.\\n[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.720]   Make it sellable.

It's really interesting how you're using Whisper.cpp, and it's a great idea about like scanning every podcast everywhere and using that potentially as a\\n[00:26.320 --> 00:34.240]  add-on service or just simply a marketing tool for Potline FM, but you ask for feedback on like,\\n[00:34.240 --> 00:44.960]  what do we think? I do think it would be a major deviation diluting your focus from the feature\\n[00:45.520 --> 00:53.680]  add-on on Potline because it's a drastically different value proposition and offering,\\n[00:54.320 --> 01:01.920]  whereas you can funnel all of that energy and then essentialism sort of way towards building out or\\n[01:01.920 --> 01:08.240]  fixing bugs or whatever for Potline, even though this other idea is great. So you wanted some\\n[01:08.240 --> 01:15.040]  feedback. Those are my initial thoughts, and it's only because of the whole like staying focused on\\n[01:15.040 --> 01:22.640]  your core product, even though the other product is fun and interesting and even a great value\\n[01:22.640 --> 01:29.520]  add for podcasters, like that data and having the ability to see what's going on in real time\\n[01:29.520 --> 01:36.000]  is useful, but it's very different. Yeah, it's super different. Thanks so much, Mahogany.\\n[01:36.000 --> 01:40.720]  I really appreciate it, and I love that Potline allows me to receive such feedback,\\n[01:40.720 --> 01:47.920]  but it has a problem, and this problem is me. As much as I love to tinker with technologies and\\n[01:47.920 --> 01:53.440]  of all kinds, really, I want my SaaS experiments to result in a profitable business. This isn't just\\n[01:53.440 --> 01:59.520]  supposed to be a fun activity. I want my work to ultimately create a long-term asset for me and my\\n[01:59.520 --> 02:06.320]  family. Now, Potline, my podcast voicemail product that you just heard, has the potential to become\\n[02:06.320 --> 02:11.200]  a business. There are a few competitors out there and alternatives that people pay money for,\\n[02:11.840 --> 02:18.320]  but Podscan, my newest project, has shown overwhelming demand in comparison to Potline.\\n[02:18.320 --> 02:23.040]  Not only are there tools in the wild that are used by thousands or hundreds of thousands of marketers\\n[02:23.040 --> 02:28.640]  for similar purposes, but I've been bombarded already with messages of interest and willingness\\n[02:28.640 --> 02:34.080]  to pay with this product. And this has not happened for Potline yet, but it sure is\\n[02:34.080 --> 02:40.560]  happening now with Potscan, because Potscan fits into a budget, because it's so much like things\\n[02:40.640 --> 02:46.240]  that people already pay for. It's a tool that people understand as a necessity, because similar\\n[02:46.240 --> 02:50.960]  things are already necessitated by the work they do. And that is why I'm chasing it.\\n[02:51.680 --> 02:57.040]  Evidence of demand. A pull from the market. That's what I see. That's why I'm going into\\n[02:57.040 --> 03:01.600]  that direction. I don't intend to stick with an idea because it was the first one that made\\n[03:01.600 --> 03:06.880]  sense to me. It is great that that was the first idea, but that is not enough. Readiness\\n[03:06.880 --> 03:12.000]  to pivot in the face of changing circumstances is a pretty important part of entrepreneurship.\\n[03:12.000 --> 03:16.080]  And it's not a very popular position too. I got a lot of messages like the one from earlier\\n[03:16.080 --> 03:21.120]  that focused a lot on this lack of perceived consistency. Particularly if you're building a\\n[03:21.120 --> 03:25.600]  public, you will occasionally get feedback like that. And I completely understand it.\\n[03:25.600 --> 03:30.560]  I've been having these thoughts for weeks now too. Like this isn't new. It's a pretty substantial\\n[03:30.560 --> 03:36.560]  internal struggle for me. I'm asking myself the same questions, but I know that I'm still\\n[03:36.560 --> 03:42.560]  relentlessly executing, even when I pivot my efforts a few months into a project. The\\n[03:42.560 --> 03:48.960]  sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy and I am allowed to not fall for it. I'm allowed to stop sinking\\n[03:48.960 --> 03:56.080]  effort into a less promising project when a more promising project also exists. And that is my\\n[03:56.080 --> 04:01.200]  founder agency. And I feel I would be limiting myself if I considered myself or my project a\\n[04:01.200 --> 04:07.840]  failure, just because a better opportunity presented itself. Consistency for consistency's\\n[04:07.840 --> 04:14.720]  sake is folly for almost anything you can do. And I need to be honest with myself here,\\n[04:14.720 --> 04:20.400]  just looking at my projects, Podline is a great product, but it is not yet a great business.\\n[04:21.040 --> 04:25.520]  I think it's mostly feature complete. It does what it's supposed to do, right? You can\\n[04:25.520 --> 04:29.280]  get voicemails, you can send voicemails, you can embed it wherever you need to.\\n[04:29.280 --> 04:34.160]  If people wanted to really use it, they could. And it has seen some usage, but so far,\\n[04:34.160 --> 04:39.360]  no paying customers. But meanwhile, I'm getting really strong payment intent signals\\n[04:39.920 --> 04:46.640]  from professionals in businesses, in my emails and DMs on a daily basis for Podscan.\\n[04:47.200 --> 04:53.200]  So the path forward is really clear to me here. And so is the path that led me here.\\n[04:53.200 --> 05:00.080]  I think I'm Mary Condoing Podline at this point, it sparked joy. And now it can rest. And I think\\n[05:00.080 --> 05:05.840]  it sparked more than joy, really, Podscan would not exist without Podline, both technologically,\\n[05:05.840 --> 05:12.160]  because I got into the Laravel world and the AI systems that I built for for Podline were\\n[05:12.160 --> 05:18.160]  really, really useful to have built and understood for Podscan. And in terms of market,\\n[05:18.160 --> 05:22.320]  Podline allowed me to freely explore and experience the space that I haven't operated in\\n[05:22.320 --> 05:29.120]  podcasting, you know, and AI products. Now that I'm picking up the breadcrumbs of visible demand\\n[05:29.120 --> 05:35.040]  that I see strewn all around me really, my game plan with Podscan is also much, much clearer,\\n[05:35.680 --> 05:41.440]  which makes this pivot so much easier, because I can understand how to easily market this\\n[05:41.440 --> 05:46.240]  particular product, because I'm building a marketing tool, I can use it for my own marketing.\\n[05:46.240 --> 05:51.040]  One of the most validated use cases for having a podcast observation tool like this\\n[05:51.040 --> 05:55.040]  has been figuring out where my competitors advertise. That's one of the things that a lot\\n[05:55.040 --> 06:00.080]  of people come to me for now. Like, where are those people that I compete with? And which podcast do\\n[06:00.080 --> 06:05.920]  they talk or like partner with the hosts? Or where are they talked about? Where can I also\\n[06:05.920 --> 06:10.880]  be talked about? That is what Podscan was built for. It's what it's predestined for. That's why\\n[06:10.880 --> 06:15.520]  I built this in the first place, because I wanted to know where Podline's competitors are\\n[06:15.520 --> 06:19.920]  being talked about. And I'm still using it for this too. Like I am using Podscan for\\n[06:19.920 --> 06:26.880]  Podline marketing, because I can. So just to figure out where people use tools for voicemail.\\n[06:26.880 --> 06:32.240]  I just earlier today got a notification from Podscan that looked into all podcasts that are\\n[06:32.240 --> 06:36.080]  released everywhere, just for certain terms. And one of the terms that I look for there\\n[06:36.080 --> 06:41.520]  is Speakpipe, because Speakpipe is a competitor for Podline. And I just earlier today learned\\n[06:41.520 --> 06:47.760]  that the Sarah Silverman podcast uses Speakpipe. And now I know I can talk to this very\\n[06:47.840 --> 06:53.600]  established podcast by a very established comedian and see if they're interested in my Podline\\n[06:53.600 --> 06:57.840]  product. That is the feature that so many people want to figure out. Where are the competitors\\n[06:57.840 --> 07:03.600]  talked about? And I'll just create alerts for the companies that I want to market to.\\n[07:03.600 --> 07:08.000]  And I track mentions of themselves and their competitors. I send them a screenshot or make\\n[07:08.000 --> 07:12.320]  a screencast and that should create some interest even in the coldest of outreach\\n[07:12.320 --> 07:18.480]  cases, because it is very clear what the value of this is. And one thing I realized as well\\n[07:19.360 --> 07:24.320]  is that most people aren't podcasters in my audience and in general, but in my network,\\n[07:24.320 --> 07:29.360]  almost everyone has to market in some way. They have to bring something themselves, their product,\\n[07:29.360 --> 07:35.040]  their business, their books, their courses, whatever it is, to market. And there is value\\n[07:35.040 --> 07:39.600]  in understanding that market better and knowing where people are. And the massive positive\\n[07:39.600 --> 07:44.400]  feedback from the community, coupled with very clear use cases that I've already seen,\\n[07:44.400 --> 07:48.880]  means that my positioning and my messaging will have so much more impact for Podscan\\n[07:48.880 --> 07:55.360]  than it could ever have had for Podline. So that's where I am right now. I'm allowed to pivot.\\n[07:55.360 --> 08:00.160]  And I'm not trapped. I get to choose what I work on and what signals I listen to.\\n[08:00.160 --> 08:05.600]  And this is still a very calculated decision. I wondered about switching things up a few times\\n[08:05.600 --> 08:11.040]  during building Podline, but every single time there, I said no. At that point, the product\\n[08:11.040 --> 08:15.840]  that I was building right then with Podline was the best option around, but that has changed.\\n[08:16.560 --> 08:22.800]  Now I say yes to Podscan. And you'll see me talking about Podscan a lot more quite soon.\\n[08:22.800 --> 08:27.920]  I'm kind of slowly launching it. I think as this comes out, the website will be up. If you want\\n[08:27.920 --> 08:32.080]  to check it out, podscan.fm, that's where it's going to live. That's where it's already living\\n[08:32.080 --> 08:38.320]  and already ingesting data. I think I just earlier today broke, what is it? Like over 20,000 podcasts\\n[08:38.320 --> 08:45.280]  ingested and over 40,000 or 50,000 episodes. I think it's 50,000 episodes and 40,000 of them\\n[08:45.280 --> 08:51.040]  I have transcribed over the last couple of days. It's bizarre. The technology of that is super fun.\\n[08:51.040 --> 08:55.920]  And just seeing it automatically, just chug along and get information in there is really,\\n[08:55.920 --> 08:59.840]  really enjoyable. But I'm going to talk more about this. I'm going to talk more about\\n[08:59.840 --> 09:06.960]  how I will just market it, grow the business. It is complete in a sense that people can start\\n[09:06.960 --> 09:12.240]  using it. If you are a marketer, if you're somebody who wants to understand where certain\\n[09:12.240 --> 09:17.520]  keywords, certain phrases, certain themes are mentioned on podcasts, reach out to me.\\n[09:17.520 --> 09:22.320]  Send me at the M on Twitter, send me an email to arvid at podscan.fm or arvid at the\\n[09:22.320 --> 09:26.800]  bootsterfounder.com or wherever you find my email. You just, you find me and you send me a message\\n[09:27.360 --> 09:32.000]  and I can get you onboarded as a beta tester. There's a trial and obviously I'm going to\\n[09:32.000 --> 09:36.320]  extend it for people who are helping me test in this very, very early stage. And we can\\n[09:36.320 --> 09:40.080]  figure something out. I just want to see if this is a product that's useful for you\\n[09:40.080 --> 09:44.080]  and the early people that help me, they will get to see a massive benefit from this. I can\\n[09:44.080 --> 09:48.960]  promise you that. So that is where I'm right now. I'm very much enjoying my work and I'm\\n[09:48.960 --> 09:53.760]  going to get right back to it. So that's it for today. I will now briefly thank my sponsor\\n[09:53.760 --> 09:57.840]  acquire.com because in a way selling your business is also a kind of pivot. And I kind\\n[09:57.840 --> 10:04.400]  of want to talk about this today. If you were ever at a point where another path lays in front of\\n[10:04.400 --> 10:09.440]  you, it's not just continuing with the thing that you've done for years, but also just turning the\\n[10:09.440 --> 10:14.960]  value you created into something else, into cash, into an asset that you can use in a different\\n[10:14.960 --> 10:20.880]  way, then you might actually want to consider just selling your business or getting a business\\n[10:20.880 --> 10:27.200]  acquired. Because creating financial stability or security, just a little step towards financial\\n[10:27.200 --> 10:33.360]  stability is a very, very important step in anybody's life, any founder's life really.\\n[10:33.360 --> 10:38.640]  We built things that are risky. And at some point you might want to de-risk it.\\n[10:39.520 --> 10:44.560]  And that's what an acquisition can do for you. Because you change, right? I talked a lot about\\n[10:44.560 --> 10:49.520]  change in this episode today. Things change, opportunities change, challenges change, and we\\n[10:49.520 --> 10:54.800]  ourselves change over time. And maybe you're just done with the work. Maybe you reached a skill\\n[10:54.800 --> 11:00.160]  ceiling or just want a different lifestyle. A lot of parents experience this. A lot of people who are\\n[11:00.960 --> 11:05.520]  getting kids late in life, they all of a sudden figure out, no, I don't want to work like 60\\n[11:05.520 --> 11:11.120]  hours a week on my business. I would rather take the value of that business now in cash,\\n[11:11.120 --> 11:15.600]  invest it over the next couple of years into a different lifestyle. And I can spend more time\\n[11:15.600 --> 11:20.480]  with my kids. That's an outcome that I see a lot of the time happening when people sell their\\n[11:20.480 --> 11:25.920]  business. But no matter why you need a change, selling your business can be a very impactful\\n[11:25.920 --> 11:32.000]  and positive experience. And especially if you sell your SaaS on acquire.com, because the folks\\n[11:32.000 --> 11:36.160]  over there, they will help you make it a positive and impactful experience. They have helped\\n[11:36.160 --> 11:40.720]  thousands of people sell their valuable businesses for life-changing amounts of money. You don't\\n[11:40.720 --> 11:45.520]  have to sell today, by the way, but you just should take a look at it. Because if you're ever\\n[11:45.520 --> 11:50.880]  interested in pivoting into financial security, you probably want to check out acquire.com. So\\n[11:50.880 --> 11:55.760]  go to try.acquire.com slash arvid and see if this is for you and your business right now.\\n[11:55.760 --> 12:00.640]  And if it's not, check it out anyway, because it's always good to plan ahead. These moments\\n[12:00.640 --> 12:05.600]  are pivotal quite literally. And I know I'm making wordplay here. It's intentional. I kind\\n[12:05.600 --> 12:13.360]  of like it. But the act of selling a business has been probably the most mind-blowing upgrade\\n[12:13.360 --> 12:18.720]  of my life. Like I'm literally sitting in the house that selling this business bought.\\n[12:20.160 --> 12:26.800]  All I do is build on that exit really. So if that is something you might want to see in your\\n[12:26.800 --> 12:32.400]  future, acquire will take you there and they will help you get to that point. Thank you\\n[12:32.400 --> 12:37.520]  for listening really today. I'm so excited to talk about these things. I could barely find words.\\n[12:37.520 --> 12:42.960]  You can find me on Twitter at arvidkal, arvidkal, khl, and you'll find my books on my Twitter\\n[12:42.960 --> 12:47.040]  course too. If you want to support me and this show, please subscribe to my YouTube channel,\\n[12:47.040 --> 12:51.120]  get the podcast, your podcast player of choice and leave a five star rating and a great review\\n[12:51.120 --> 12:55.360]  by going to rate this podcast.com slash founder. It really makes a massive difference for me.\\n[12:55.360 --> 12:58.880]  If you show up there, because then the podcast will show up in other people's feeds.\\n[12:58.880 --> 13:02.560]  And that's where I would love for it to be. Any of this will help the show.\\n[13:02.560 --> 13:05.680]  Thank you so much for listening. Have a wonderful day and bye-bye.\\nTranscription results written to '\\\/home\\\/forge\\\/transcribe.sonicengage.com\\\/releases\\\/20240204155445' directory\",\"episode_description\":\"<p>Join me as I dive into a crucial choice every entrepreneur faces, balancing what excites us with what makes sense.

He has built an amazing business and sold it for $3.5 million. I'm talking to a non-technical guy today. Even though he's built a SaaS product and it's going to be really interesting to see a non-technical perspective on building software products. This episode is sponsored by Acquire.com. We're going to talk a lot about acquisitions today. Now here is Spencer.\\n[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:42.700]   Welcome to the show. You bootstrapped a SaaS product to 140KMR and it had 6 million daily users. Four years quite the accomplishment. This whole led to a $3.5 million exit. Post exit, you're also working on new projects and you're investing your money and all that.\\n[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.700]   I think you're living the dream that a lot of SaaS founders really want to live. How many failed ideas and products did it take for you to get to this point? What do you think?\\n[00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:02.200]   First off, thank you for having me on your podcast. I'm a big fan. I've been following you for a while. I love the product that you're creating right now. I may try to convince you that to let me be an investor at some point.\\n[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   We'll get into that at the end. As far as failed ideas, listen, every Bootstrapped Founder has all of these ideas that they're trying to product market fit and they're trying to find what their niche is.\\n[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:26.700]   It really is just a matter of getting that niche and what and also what you're passionate about. For me, I was a financial advisor at a financial institution.\\n[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:36.000]   I jumped around from doing that for a while. I did different banks, different investment firms. My thing was I always just wanted to make a lot of money.\\n[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   My thinking at a college was, where's the money? It's at the banks. I'm going to go to the banks and do it. The problem is it's still technically working retail.\\n[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Whether people like to admit it or not, you're just selling products, credit cards, checking accounts, and then eventually investment products and things of that nature, but that's still where the money is.\\n[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I got licensed. They had me go through all this training and everything with SEC and FINRA and the whole nonsense.\\n[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I was like, \\\"Well, I can make money day trading.\\\" I started day trading and I'm like, \\\"All right, I'm making decent money here.\\\"\\n[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I actually ended up meeting up with another day trader who was exponentially better than I was.\\n[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   My trades, I'm like, \\\"Oh, yeah, I made like 30 percent.\\\" He's like, \\\"I made 7,000 percent like crazy, crazy numbers kind of guy.\\\"\\n[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We actually teamed up and said, \\\"Hey, let's do this together.\\\" We started day trading together, sharing ideas and different options to look at.\\n[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Eventually, it got to the point where I was like, \\\"Why don't we just sell the information of how you identify the different trade options that you're looking at, opening range breakouts,\\n[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   and looking at the SMA and the moving averages,\\\" and stuff like that. He goes, \\\"Yeah, sure, we could sell the information on what I'm looking at.\\\"\\n[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Or just live stream between the daily kind of stuff. So I said, \\\"All right, let's start marketing. I'll market it.\\n[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You just do the trades because your trades are better.\\\" I said, \\\"But I'm pretty decent at social media.\\\"\\n[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So started an Instagram account. That's all it really was back then because this was a couple years ago.\\n[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Twitter was more just for journalists and TikTok wasn't a thing yet. It was a pre-pandemic.\\n[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And so I just started posting all the winning screenshots of what he was doing and all the trades that we were making and everything.\\n[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Well, within a few months, we had 300 people paying us $30 a month. And that was within 90 to 120 days.\\n[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so I'm like, \\\"Oh man, this is getting crazy the number of subscriptions we're getting.\\\"\\n[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm like, \\\"But I gotta figure out how to manage this better.\\\" And so that's when the kind of product market fit started clicking going,\\n[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   \\\"Okay, I'm having this issue as someone who's doing this.\\\" So I started researching other people who were doing similar things in that space,\\n[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   in the educational, kind of finance educational space. And I saw that they were having the same similar issues.\\n[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I'm like, \\\"Well, if I'm not the only one having the issues and they're having these issues, that must mean there's a gap here somewhere\\n[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   that I could build something that would make it easier for them to do it.\\\"\\n[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And that's really all building a SaaS is all about, is just filling a gap for someone to help them do what they do better.\\n[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And so whether they're a designer, whether they're running a small business or whatever it is, if you make a tool for them,\\n[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   a SaaS tool or something that helps their life automate, it completely redefines the way that they work.\\n[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And if you could automate the workflow for someone in something that they care about or in the field that they're looking for,\\n[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   that just, I mean, that really, you know, takes a cake.\\n[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah, for sure. And then that's what SaaS is like, that's the magic of SaaS, right?\\n[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You just take this job to be done that people kind of struggle through for days and you just automate it into like a 20 second kind of script.\\n[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   That's just the absolute magic.\\n[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I mean, that's the absolute best. I mean, even currently, you know, there's these new everything nowadays, I feel like is an open AI API tool with a tailwind wrapper.\\n[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I mean, that's pretty much all it is, but they're pretty damn cool.\\n[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Like, you know, you got the auto headshot, more than headshot magic one, and now that's a little played out and then you got the chat with PDFs and that's a little played out.\\n[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But there's other ones that are like, hey, we automatically take your video and clip it into YouTube shorts and Twitch shorts and stuff like that.\\n[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I'm like, man, like these, to be able to do that and just completely remove the edit of the tediousness of a process like editing or something like that.\\n[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I mean, that is worth paying for.\\n[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And if you build a product and that that was the goal to build something as sticky as possible, something that people go, well, I can't work without this now.\\n[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And that's kind of trying to identify that.\\n[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   You really just got to look around and see, hey, what are people really have, you know, what do they have gripes with and what's tedious in their life?\\n[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Whatever that may be, it could be B2B, could be B2C, you know, what are customers having an issue doing?\\n[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Oh, you know, converting my Figma into a website.\\n[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Well, now there's a SaaS for that.\\n[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Just drop drag and drop the file and boom.\\n[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Now it's a full page website.\\n[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So things like that, you know, that's kind of how I think people should take a look at it when they're when they're bootstrapping and building in public.\\n[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Oh, for sure. Like, particularly the building and public part with the community being so extremely supportive and helpful with it.\\n[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Like, all right, that's just, but I want to ask you a question.\\n[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I kind of getting back to your financial educational project.\\n[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Like, would you have built a project or a SaaS business in a space that you didn't already work in at that point?\\n[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Or was that part of the magic for you to be consistently involved in financial trading to build something for traders?\\n[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   So the thing was actually building the SaaS was not in my space, right?\\n[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Because that was me going off and saying, hey, I'm going to hire a developer.\\n[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I know nothing about developing.\\n[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I still can't touch a line of code today.\\n[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I have a great macro understanding of technology and code now because when you chat with a developer for 12 hours a day for years, you gain a very good understanding of technology, but I still can't write any code.\\n[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So the point was, you know, being able to hire other developers as a non-developer, that was a challenge.\\n[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I mean, that was, I went through almost 100 different developers that I interviewed.\\n[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And going through all of that, you know, to build something that I still didn't know, hey, this, I mean, let me tell you, the first MVP was garbage.\\n[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I mean, when I tell you garbage, it was the worst MVP you could ever imagine.\\n[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It was built like in Django and it would like crash every couple of hours, but being in sales, I was like, I could still, I could sell the hell out of it.\\n[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Like, I'm just going to, you need this in your life because it does the X, Y, and Z.\\n[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And that's a lot that I think is something that a lot of the building public community is missing.\\n[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   They're getting it vicariously through posting, but they're, I don't feel like they're as motivated for selling as they need to be.\\n[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They're plugging their product every now and then on Twitter, yeah, I'm building this, I'm building this, I'm building this.\\n[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   But what's the pitch? You need a pitch and you need to target your audience because not necessarily your audience is the building public people.\\n[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So that's always a big, big problem. And that's a big problem.\\n[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I think for most people who come from more like an engineering background, I don't know like how that was with the engineers that you talked to and that you tried to hire and the people that you ended up hiring.\\n[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   But I think for my experience and the people that I get to talk to, like marketing, selling, that's always a red flag for an engineer.\\n[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   For some reason, there's this weird distinction between making the thing and making the thing go to other people.\\n[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And this line shall not be crossed. It's super weird. How did you deal with that in the people that you worked with?\\n[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Well, I think, well, first of all, don't get me wrong, those interviews were crazy.\\n[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I mean, I would say like a good third of the interviews didn't even turn on their camera. And I'm like, \\\"Hey, I'm trying to have a conversation with you that I don't have a good camera.\\\"\\n[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And I'm like, \\\"Wow, that's like, talk about really not wanting to get out of your shell.\\\"\\n[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And you know, listen, I get that some people are not talkers. And to be honest, I feel like engineers who want to work behind a computer purposely chose that career so they don't have to go down that road of, you know, talking and video chats and, you know, marketing their product.\\n[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But being an engineer and being a solopreneur are two different things.\\n[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You're now taking the whole pie that, you know, the whole thing, you're responsible for it.\\n[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So you can't only just say, \\\"I'm going to be the back end guy.\\\" And yeah, I'll post some things.\\n[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And now you got to be the face. And, you know, there's some founders out there who are doing it very well.\\n[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   But a lot of people out there are just not marketing to them, you know, marketing to the masses as themselves as, \\\"Hey, I'm the brand.\\\"\\n[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:47.200]   so is the product, but here it is. And so, talking with those developers, interviewing them,\\n[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:54.320]   I finally got one who was decent, very good at what he did. Personality-wise, it wasn't a good\\n[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   mix, but he was so damn good that it was like, all right, fine. And at the time, it was bootstrapped.\\n[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.280]   So I was using my savings account money to fund this thing. So someone who was able to work with\\n[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.800]   me within my budget, you kind of just have to make do.\\n[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.720]   Yeah, I guess. That's the thing about being a entrepreneur. It's like compromise all over\\n[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.920]   the place internally and with the things that you do. You can only do so much. You can only do\\n[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.160]   the thing that you're currently focused on and everything else has to kind of be scheduled.\\n[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.680]   So did you immediately hire? How big was the team as the business was starting?\\n[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:38.080]   Did you immediately hire and then hired later? So I originally hired one developer to build the\\n[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.960]   MVP. And so the MVP didn't need, I mean, don't get me wrong, it needed maintenance,\\n[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.440]   but not maintenance that I couldn't do, like restarting the server and, you know,\\n[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.920]   clicking on and off on DigitalOcean, like, oh, like, you know, like, that's how, yeah, like,\\n[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.960]   well, it crashed. Let me just click the button there, you know. So, I mean, I could do that stuff.\\n[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.640]   So after the MVP was built and I spent too much money for a crappy MVP. And again,\\n[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.280]   because I just couldn't build it myself, but I had this idea and I knew I needed to use it. So,\\n[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.680]   you know, a lot of the issue was, sorry, what was the question again?\\n[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.920]   Well, the question was, like, who did you hire and what were the steps that you took? Like,\\n[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.240]   did you hire more people immediately or did you slowly hire later? That's kind of the idea.\\n[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:30.160]   So basically, I hired, you know, for the initial MVP, but the problem was once that MVP was done,\\n[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.880]   I just decided I'm like, I'm going to market this and I'm just going to run with it because I don't\\n[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.760]   want to one have the running cost of having a developer on staff because I just couldn't afford\\n[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.920]   it. So I waited until after I started onboarding other people onto the system, more customers.\\n[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.120]   Once I got more customers on the system, I then took that revenue. Once I started recouping some\\n[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.040]   of the money that I invested in the product, and then I said, all right, now I'm going to start\\n[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.680]   looking for someone who could come on full time because we started getting feedback requests.\\n[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.360]   Like, hey, we need features and we need this and we need that. And I'm like, oh, man, I can't\\n[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.000]   just leave them in a lurch because there were other merchants or customers that wanted to be on my\\n[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.840]   system that wouldn't leave their system unless we had X feature. So I'm like, well, okay, if you\\n[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.360]   guarantee that you'll bring over your X amount of audience, I'll get that feature built. And they're\\n[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   like, sure, we'll do it. So I listen, one of the big things that my mom taught me was just say, yes,\\n[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.480]   and figure it out later. And so that's what I ended up doing a lot, a lot of the time with this,\\n[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.080]   like, you know, someone would say, hey, could you do this? And if it was worth it to invest in that\\n[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.640]   product or that, I mean, in that feature set, I would just say, yeah, so yeah, sure, we could do\\n[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.760]   that. And then figure it out later. But not the business. And then that we you're basically\\n[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.600]   front loading it. Yeah, and I talked to Rob Walling about this too, a couple weeks ago on this show,\\n[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.800]   like, should you build features for people who say they're going to buy once they get the feature?\\n[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.080]   And it was kind of a maybe answer, I guess, depending on how involved they are and how truthful that\\n[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.160]   statement actually is that you ever run into situations where you build it and they didn't come?\\n[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.840]   Yes, of course, because the dealing with the general public, you're going to have that,\\n[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.400]   you're going to have a lot of disappointments dealing with the general public, not everybody,\\n[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.960]   not everybody is like the building public founder community where they're all supportive and\\n[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.720]   rah, rah, rah, they could get on your system be like, yeah, I wanted you to build this. It\\n[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.960]   turns out I don't like it. It sucks. And then they leave. And you just go, man, what a disappointment.\\n[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.520]   I mean, there are times that we invested money into building like a full landing custom landing\\n[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.560]   page for a certain customer. And all of a sudden they're just like, yeah, we decided we just didn't\\n[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.320]   want to switch. And yet we spent thousands of dollars on getting a custom graphics and hiring\\n[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.160]   someone to do it, but just didn't go. So what then we do is repackage it as a general feature\\n[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.240]   for everybody and just make it usable across the masses.\\n[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.280]   I love that. That's a wonderful idea. It's kind of turning the loss into a win for more people\\n[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.440]   than we're initially even involved. That's really cool. Yeah, that's, I think that's\\n[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.480]   if you like that, you're gonna love how I handle customer service. Well, please go ahead.\\n[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:19.040]   So what we did with customer service is I originally, so we had a lot of different\\n[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.480]   customers using the system, you know, six million daily users. And so we could identify who the\\n[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.280]   power users were. So I ended up contacting one power user. I was like, Hey, if I give you the\\n[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.560]   system completely for free, will you be our main support guy and just help on board\\n[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.080]   all the, you know, the new people that have questions? And so he goes, yeah, sure, no problem.\\n[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.360]   So we started working together and then after a while, he started recruiting other power users\\n[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.880]   of the system. So by the end of it, we had five to seven power users getting the system completely\\n[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.640]   free or for like very affordable. And they would just be 24 seven being the customer support.\\n[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.000]   Didn't cost me a dime other than, you know, what they're lost revenue.\\n[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.600]   But they were, they use the system every day. So who better to explain, you know, the new feature\\n[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.680]   set or, you know, how to use it or the best use case than someone who's using it for their\\n[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.160]   business every single day. That's so cool. Like recruiting from your own user base is\\n[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.360]   probably one of the best kept secrets or the most high impact secrets that you have as a bootstrapper.\\n[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.600]   Like those people, particularly early customers who've been with you have seen the growth,\\n[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.080]   seen the effort you put into it for them, right? Those people they will, they will do, they will\\n[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.280]   go out of their way to make your life easier, which is really, really awesome.\\n[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.080]   They're the brand ambassadors. I mean, they're the, those brand ambassadors are so invaluable.\\n[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.880]   I mean, they're so valuable that it's, you really just need to take a look and say, okay,\\n[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.120]   who's doing the most for the business? Not to take away or detract from their business,\\n[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.160]   but how can they, you help them help you? And that's really the, that's really the key here.\\n[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.400]   Is that something you figured out like by random chance or was that intentional from the start,\\n[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.240]   the treating them this way? It was more, not random, but it's similar to the product,\\n[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.440]   you know, a product market fit. I was finding an issue with my own time management in the\\n[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.160]   beginning because now I'm dealing with the people who had customer service issues. I had to project\\n[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.720]   manage. I had to kind of lead the marketing campaigns. I was doing everything on the business\\n[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   side except for the coding, not the infrastructure or the security or anything like that, but I was\\n[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.240]   doing all of that stuff. And I go, well, the customer service is eating up X amount of time\\n[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.040]   for my daily schedule. I could be using that for project planning. I could be using that for road\\n[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.840]   mapping. Any of the other things that I could be doing that are, you know, it's calculating where\\n[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.120]   your time is best spent. As you know, with the 25 projects that you have going on, what is going\\n[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.480]   to obtain the most value for your time? And because you're the only one who can kind of see the vision,\\n[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.800]   you have to be your own best judge of time management because that's one of the things that will\\n[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.320]   kill a founder's business. If you have poor time management and you spend three hours on two\\n[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.600]   pixels, moving it back and forth because you don't like it's not centered or whatever,\\n[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.200]   you're fixating and you need to break away. I mean, that's the thing. So customer service,\\n[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.960]   I said, I needed to break away. And so that's when I got the power user to start. And that was\\n[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.800]   pretty early on. Do you have a framework for this? Like when you make that choice?\\n[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.160]   So I usually kind of break up my day into specific sprints. And I know it sounds crazy to break\\n[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.080]   up your day into like hourly kind of sprints. But I have, I've got about 30 alarms on my phone.\\n[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   And it's pretty, pretty wild. Like, when I should wake up, when I should take my pills,\\n[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.560]   when I should have my breakfast, when it's time to get in the chair, when it's time to drink water,\\n[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.120]   like the whole thing, because I need to remove as much of that as possible, the decision-making\\n[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.080]   process out of there. And so when I have a block assigned for a specific amount of time,\\n[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.920]   if I go over more consistently in, let's say, a week or two week period, I'll say, okay,\\n[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.160]   you know what? This time slot is obviously not working. Why is it not working? And then I'll turn\\n[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.960]   around and say, okay, it's because this time slot is eating into this time slot. I need to\\n[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.040]   somehow make an adjustment to make it more worthwhile because the return on investment of a time is,\\n[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.600]   you know, the time cost is just not there. So that's how I generally prioritize.\\n[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.160]   That's awesome. Like tracking, that's one of the things that I'm really bad at, like tracking the\\n[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.320]   time that I spend on stuff, because I'm so curiosity driven. And that is what often creates a lot of\\n[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.160]   friction in my schedule, that if I didn't have like actual deadline set, I would just like play\\n[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.360]   around with stuff all the time. And that makes it kind of hard to track the time and then look back\\n[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.280]   and do some analysis, because I don't have anything to track or anything to do like that.\\n[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.160]   That's why I have a nighttime reserved for research. And I call it research, but really,\\n[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.200]   it's, you know, watching YouTube videos and, you know, like, you know, just kind of\\n[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:50.000]   exactly diving into, you know, Reddit threads and stuff like, but you know, that research is also\\n[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.160]   valuable because you turn around and you could say, you know, you go into a thread on Reddit and\\n[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.240]   you just say, wow, a lot of people are having this issue with things. Why? And then you start\\n[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.640]   grab it holding. And that's, I try to, I try to be careful about rabbit holding, because,\\n[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.280]   you know, then it's 3am, I still haven't slept, I got to be up at 9 to start my routine. And I'm\\n[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.680]   like, man, like, that rabbit hole was good, but I'll wait till, you know, you just kind of\\n[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.920]   prioritize the time and save it for later. Do you still have as rigid or as like, you know,\\n[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.320]   intense of a schedule now that you've sold the business?\\n[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:50.380]   I still have the drive because I feel that structure in your life is important. I feel like routine is extremely important for people otherwise they fall into kind of I don't want to call it a rut but they fall into a just a pattern of haphazardness and so it doesn't have to be as rigid where I go oh man I'm 15 minutes over I gotta you know do it but I go oh I'll just keep you know some accurate time like okay yeah you know what it's time for me to.\\n[00:19:50.380 --> 00:20:00.380]   Start shifting gears into something else and that could be even hey I went over by half an hour it's time for me to work out I gotta stop what I'm doing so I can take care of my body now.\\n[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:11.580]   So you know still having that schedule I think is important because it's not just work at this point now it's the whole picture of your life because when you're in that business and you're in that grind.\\n[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:26.580]   You you you hyper focus and then every you I'm sure there's been times where you haven't eaten for seven hours straight and you go oh man where's lunch but if I didn't have that time blocked off I would have said oh man I'm just gonna go hungry you know that's you need to kind of.\\n[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.580]   I personally like it just because it takes a lot of the decision making out of my life.\\n[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:44.580]   I like this bigger picture idea you just talked about because I can very much relate to this is happen to me too when I sold the business that stuff just changed like my perspective on economics on my own economic choices and all that change.\\n[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:54.580]   How did that change for you because 3.5 million dollars is a lot of money and I know there's still taxes and all kinds of other things that could come off this but still it's a it's a seven figure deal.\\n[00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:05.580]   How how did that impact the choices that you made both for yourself like for your life for your loved ones and the structure of your day and maybe maybe also just look for for what you care about that this point.\\n[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:22.580]   Of course so I think you know one of the things we don't I mean our taxes are German taxes for sure but they're pretty damn close I mean you know recently these taxes just go in through the roof but you have to remember at that point I was already bootstrapped\\n[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   and we were ready making a hundred and forty thousand a month.\\n[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:34.580]   So the thing was the the programmer's salary right so he's on a he's on a fixed schedule any of bonuses and things of that nature.\\n[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:47.580]   But after you know the margins were over 90% because like $2,000 a month to run maybe and that's without like marketing costs and stuff like that variable.\\n[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:57.580]   So for $2,000 a month pulling in that much it was just time though because I was you know listen I was the only I was the business half.\\n[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:06.580]   So when something would go wrong on the programming side which it always does you know I mean that's just what happens something crashes it breaks there's an update.\\n[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.580]   When that happens it's three in the morning it's two in the morning it's five a.m. It doesn't matter what time.\\n[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:19.580]   You got to get up and you got to attend to your baby because when your baby is crying you have to get up and do something about it.\\n[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:33.580]   And so the issue is I'm sitting there going I'm pulling 18 hour days you know 16 18 hour days I really need to figure out what I need to prioritize in my life because at this point now I can start taking a seat back.\\n[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:44.580]   But I started looking at like getting CEOs and stuff like that but then I started thinking as a founder and you know there's better than anyone else who is really going to take care of your business better than you can.\\n[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:58.580]   And I'm not talking about like the managing the project and stuff like that but I'm talking about those three a.m. calls when there's an issue a global worldwide issue because you know we had we had customers in over 100 countries.\\n[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:06.580]   And so there was never a non prime hour because when the prime hours are over in America they were just starting somewhere else.\\n[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:19.580]   You know the European prime hours we had just we had maybe like a third of the customers in the European you know Spain Italy France and all the things so when it goes down in the middle of the night it's affecting that whole sector.\\n[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:30.580]   So I'm like you know I just felt like at some point I needed to take a step back and I said you know what pandemic delayed a lot of things in my life my wedding starting a family.\\n[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:42.580]   I just hyper focused on the business I said it I think it's time to to kind of sell I want to start a family I want to you know kind of get everything situated in my life personally versus being hyper into the business but now that\\n[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:55.580]   I'm out and exited. I do want to help other founders one grow their business and help scale because it is hard I mean it's so hard when you.\\n[00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:05.580]   Yeah you got a $500 mr how do you get to 5000 how do you get to 50,000 I mean that's the those are the real questions and it's not just about a grind a daily grind doesn't.\\n[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:11.580]   You can be doing the same process over and over again and yeah you may see results but are the most effective results.\\n[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:25.580]   You know and then there's also the fact of if founders want to exit there's a lot to exiting that whole founders have no idea because you don't even know what you don't know until you go through the process you yourself have been through a nice exit.\\n[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:32.580]   You can't even I mean you could explain it but there's things you don't know to even think to ask.\\n[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.580]   And so helping other founders with that that's why I'm starting my YouTube channel.\\n[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.580]   It's a YouTube at sass as I managed to get that handle.\\n[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.580]   So I know that you're you're good at you're excited about that.\\n[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.580]   It is so cool it is it's going to be a fun project.\\n[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.580]   What are you going to do there like how are you going to help founders with with that journey on YouTube.\\n[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.580]   So one of the things I mean it's going to be all sass obviously that's why I got the handle at sass.\\n[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:13.580]   But the I'm planning on doing three different topics one is going to be my journey and you know the things that I've learned along the way in building a multi million dollar business with one employee or one person as a non programmer.\\n[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:25.580]   So kind of going through those lessons that I've learned and how I scaled it all the different tactics I used a lot of different road mapping strategies and how to kind of best optimize your time.\\n[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:35.580]   Then the other thing is doing reviews of founders projects and they're all going to be pretty much glowing and you know if there's issues I'll mention them but to be honest they're mainly going to be glowing reviews.\\n[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:50.580]   I'm supportive. Yeah, that's right. You know look as the as the building public community you know you got to be supportive of the founders because you know what it is admirable that someone wants to take their time and say, I'm done with the grind I'm done with the\\n[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.580]   I'm done being the slave to the corporate or the you know we're making money for someone else.\\n[00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:11.580]   So, I have to support these people because they've got a dream and they're taking the step to at least try and that's that's what matters and if they tried four or five six times okay, what can how can we help how can I help them change the way they're doing things to make it a successful\\n[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:24.580]   a successful product adventure. And then the other thing would be founder interviews. So after we do a bunch of reviews like let's say our view, you know this really cool product that I just found not too long ago.\\n[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:43.580]   It takes podcasts and what it does is it transcribes all the podcast and it's doing like six hundred six thousand an hour right now like a crazy number, but a product like that, which would be so cool.\\n[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:50.580]   Do a whole review of the product show the landing page how it's doing it how it's beneficial the use cases.\\n[00:26:50.580 --> 00:27:01.580]   And then afterwards interview the founder, because now they get to publicity segments they get the one of the review of the product and then to hey how did you come up with the idea what's your plan next.\\n[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:08.580]   Kind of similar to you know what most people are want to know you know on YouTube the how to's.\\n[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.580]   Well I love that.\\n[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:23.580]   Yeah and if everybody who doesn't get this little behind the scenes thing but that is the project that I'm currently working on I'm doing a podcast scanning service that I'm not sure if it's a product or not like I'm working through this myself in public right now.\\n[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:38.580]   I'm using it as a idea initially was to build it as a little marketing tool for my existing software business that I'm trying to market but now it's all getting complicated and one of the reasons that I love just talking to you right now is because I can see that you really understand like the\\n[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:52.580]   struggle of a founder wanting to build cool stuff and then coming to find there's another cool thing that I might want to build, but you're only one person and you only have your day right you're 24 hours or whatever 12 16 hours you actually have of your day.\\n[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   So I love this idea I love the idea of of using media to to impact more people.\\n[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   It's funny because you had 6 million daily users that's already a lot of people to impact with the business but I also understand having gone the same like route as you have posts as going into media how this has a different kind of impact.\\n[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:25.580]   Now what I have a question for you here like is this you could have just built another SAS that's always an option right like you could just done the exact same thing again bigger this time smaller this time whatever I could have been anything.\\n[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.580]   Why choose media why choose YouTube.\\n[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:46.580]   So I think that the big thing is I'm also still doing that so I'm also currently investing in 5 new SAS businesses per year that's kind of my own goal that I've set for myself my own metric whether it's building from scratch which to be honest I don't want to do.\\n[00:28:46.580 --> 00:29:00.580]   I'll never be a solopreneur again if I'm going to build another business I'm going to have partners so a partner for newer is is probably the way I'm going to go because I don't want to doing it all yourself man it is it's a struggle and you know.\\n[00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:30.650]   So whether I build it from scratch or I buy something off of a marketplace or what have you or just contact someone I found a pretty cool AI tool the other day that I was testing out and I was like man I would love to just get involved in this project and so I contacted them spoke to them and said hey you know how would X amount of dollar investment impact your bottom line how would it impact your growth and so we're in discussion right now about how I can become a significant partner in the business to help scale it and then\\n[00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:38.010]   bring some of those resources and some of those tools that I know how to do on my skill set and say hey let's take your business from\\n[00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:44.770]   5000 MRR let's see how we can double or triple or quadruple it in the next six to twelve months so I\\n[00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:50.090]   am still doing that but I feel that media in in a some way and and\\n[00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.930]   To preface this my startup was built in stealth\\n[00:29:54.330 --> 00:30:00.130]   Silent building public is was not even a thing when I started building my back my side of building my product\\n[00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.170]   So I didn't even think to like oh, let me just you know\\n[00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.930]   Daily blog about every single thing that I've done like I you know\\n[00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.270]   I yelled at the computer today because you know it crashed, you know\\n[00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:15.750]   Like I didn't even think you know that that was something people wanted to see so everything I did was in private\\n[00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.710]   Which you could say is the traditionalist way of doing it or not? I don't know\\n[00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:26.190]   but I certainly would go in the building public route in the future because you get that built in brand and that built in audience and\\n[00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:34.830]   Seeing the power of that brand loyalty as opposed to just being loyal to the product versus being loyal to the person and the product\\n[00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.790]   You build a tighter is a tighter glue there. So I\\n[00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.990]   Think media though could help when you're explaining from a successful point of view\\n[00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:50.390]   What the the next steps are or helping them review or getting that that you know that content out there\\n[00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.270]   And I know there's a lot of content out there already, but\\n[00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.750]   Coming from someone who's done it\\n[00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:01.990]   I feel like I do have you know some valuable advice that I can help give to some people because I mean we did silly things like we\\n[00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.830]   Yeah, we had twenty five thousand dollar contests for people to try and meet certain KPIs\\n[00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:12.390]   I mean like it was like I did random likes random. I did publicity stunts like I did things that\\n[00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.830]   I mean, it's without mentioning what the business is it's hard to describe but\\n[00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.990]   Did a lot of wild things that could give people ideas and say wow, that's that's pretty crazy\\n[00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.310]   That's awesome\\n[00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.550]   Yeah, if you have more of these things to share without like you know going into too much detail\\n[00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.550]   I'd be interested because that that stuff that you wouldn't don't really think about\\n[00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:35.150]   Particularly if you were like an introverted tech origin solopreneur\\n[00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:39.630]   They just even hearing about it can often just unlock ideas. So hey shoot\\n[00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.590]   That's what I would like to say. Oh, yeah, I mean that's that's the thing\\n[00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.150]   I mean there's it really depends on what vertical you're in and what you're targeting\\n[00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.950]   But you know, I mean if you're targeting Excel users, I wouldn't say you know do a drop money from a helicopter\\n[00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.230]   That's probably not gonna probably not their thing\\n[00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.930]   But you know seeing people compete on the Excel\\n[00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:02.950]   I mean that could get them pretty riled up and excited\\n[00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.350]   So you have to you know really know your audience\\n[00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:12.130]   But with that kind of just speak into what makes the audience tick and then kind of gear your you know\\n[00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.790]   Gear your campaigns around it and it doesn't have to be ads like spending money on the ads\\n[00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.070]   You you still have to spend money in one way or another\\n[00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:24.910]   And you use the revenue that you've generated from that once you've gotten to that point if you're not at the point of post\\n[00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:32.070]   Revenue though, you need to there's other steps you need to take prior to to doing your marketing campaigns though such as\\n[00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:37.670]   Well, I mean, you know, you need to first make sure your pricing is is on point that you're not you know\\n[00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:44.030]   Keep keep keeping the product from people you need to determine if you're doing a freemium model or if you're doing a explicitly paid model\\n[00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.030]   How low is your barrier to entry?\\n[00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:50.470]   You know, what is your you know the average lifetime value of the customer?\\n[00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:55.790]   You know, do you have heat mapping on your site to see what they're doing or where they're getting lost?\\n[00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.950]   Or if there's bugs on the site that you didn't even know not bugs like code wise\\n[00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:05.990]   But bugs UX wise because UX is just as important as UI if you turn around and you go\\n[00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.630]   Yeah, the UI is perfect\\n[00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.110]   We used a react dashboard and it's it looks, you know perfect or whatever\\n[00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.790]   But someone goes through the sign up process and there's nine clicks to get just signed up\\n[00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:19.470]   Well, you know what there's a problem with your optimization there\\n[00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:25.950]   So I feel all of those need to be ironed out before you really start broad scaling it because that's you know\\n[00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:32.510]   You want a well-oiled machine. You don't want to just get in the car turn it on and floor it and redline it because you've got to mess\\n[00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.590]   Something up you what you need to do is make sure check the oil check the you know\\n[00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.230]   The check the filter check everything and say okay now\\n[00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.990]   It's perfectly, you know Q aid and now we can go hit hit the track\\n[00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:50.830]   So between things like heat mapping and measuring and probably recording sessions and all that kind of stuff\\n[00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:57.370]   That's more kind of a technical measuring way. Did you do any like in in-person customer interviews and just watch them use the product?\\n[00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.190]   No, so I didn't actually do any of that because I didn't have enough time and\\n[00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.590]   And I say when I say I didn't have enough time\\n[00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.390]   I what I really mean is I didn't know to do that back then\\n[00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:13.990]   So I was just so into the the product before I started doing research on\\n[00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:18.630]   Extensive like how can I increase the longevity of the customer? How can I reduce churn?\\n[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:24.230]   I mean what I tell you I attended so many stupid webinars like from stripe sessions\\n[00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.430]   And from this one and that one and just like going through these things and most of them\\n[00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.270]   You could tune out after like you can log off after the first, you know\\n[00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:35.710]   Join like halfway through because the first like 20 minutes is just you know fluff anyway\\n[00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:40.390]   But once you start getting into the nitty gritty or just get the PDF review afterwards\\n[00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:42.630]   You go boom that is an interesting thing that I can do\\n[00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.910]   Maybe I I could take you know make the checkout process a little more seamless\\n[00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:51.870]   so we actually did that we we made the checkout process one click as opposed to three clicks and\\n[00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:56.670]   What we found was yeah, it did actually increase the numbers a little bit\\n[00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:02.670]   And so whether it was the same amount that they claim, you know, that's that's you know to be examined on a mass scale\\n[00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:09.790]   But you know, there were tools that we use business intelligence is is such an important part of of bootstrapping\\n[00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.750]   Because a lot of people they just look at their strike data and they're like, okay, cool\\n[00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:17.070]   Yeah, I've got you know this and there's some churn and this multi v we use a product called meta base\\n[00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:21.390]   It's a it's not a well-known product. I mean, you know, it is it's open source\\n[00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.670]   it's\\n[00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:27.870]   Probably the best business intelligence tool that I've seen for in general and that's you know\\n[00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.870]   We used it on a daily basis\\n[00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:35.950]   Multiple times a day because it was live updating analytics from our database that we can see in real time\\n[00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:40.590]   Dollars numbers churn everything. I mean when I tell you extensive\\n[00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:47.550]   We could see it was like google analytics dashboard if if they went even crazier like amazon like AWS\\n[00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.430]   Like that's how complex this thing was but you can build your own queries and maps and stuff like that. So\\n[00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:58.990]   You know having a good intelligence of what your customers are doing where they're failing why they're dropping off\\n[00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:04.990]   That was another thing that we you know had to learn along the way was, you know, that post exit\\n[00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:10.830]   Not post exit the sale, but the post exit of the post churn. I should say for the customer that exit\\n[00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.510]   Yeah, we're surveying them. Yeah surveying them and saying like hey, why did you leave?\\n[00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.670]   Not necessarily just like yeah, we're not we'll try to win them back\\n[00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.070]   But more so for our own edification to say okay\\n[00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:27.550]   Yeah, we need to we need to fix this because if they're leaving for a stupid reason that could have been fixed in two seconds\\n[00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.990]   That you know, you really need to do business intelligence\\n[00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:36.430]   So I think is one of the most important aspects that a founder needs to really get a get a good grasp on\\n[00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.950]   This blows my mind every time when I when I hear\\n[00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:46.430]   People who really have done everything dive into the specifics and it just it just shows you how much there is to do\\n[00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.270]   When you run a business like this, right?\\n[00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.710]   Like and even the technical side\\n[00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:55.870]   There are like hundreds of things that you need to think of and then there's the bi side and then there's the just a marketing side\\n[00:36:55.870 --> 00:37:01.310]   The sales side that is that's there's a lot of stuff you need to do and I think there's also a lot of advice out there\\n[00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:08.270]   Right, I guess we are kind of focused on trying to kind of even just funnel it into a shape into a conduit that works for bootstrappers\\n[00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:13.150]   But there's like you said stripe there's stripe advice out there for businesses of all sizes\\n[00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.830]   Right, what should you do for churn if you're VC or if you're like bootstrap\\n[00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:23.150]   Like how do you how do you pick the right advice that to me is always a hard question as somebody who gives advice\\n[00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:27.470]   Even for myself to answer, but how did you know what to follow and what not to follow?\\n[00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.350]   So you really have to analyze what\\n[00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.710]   What uh your situation is and kind of say okay?\\n[00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:38.030]   Well, if I'm looking at you know, this many users this much revenue\\n[00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:43.790]   How you know this many sessions? I mean you start have to you have to start going technical which again\\n[00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.870]   Like I said, I can't program but I do understand that you know the technical aspects of it\\n[00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.590]   So when you start looking at how many sessions you have and the you know the time on the page and\\n[00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:58.030]   The the difference in how sticky it is you start looking for those particular answers\\n[00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:04.270]   So stripe sessions. Yeah, maybe it was okay. You know you you start looking at some of these linked in uh, you know newsletters\\n[00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.990]   Not really that great most of them. They're like, yeah\\n[00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:13.070]   But you know some of these sessions that they have on linked in actually from the linked in people because they're you know\\n[00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.230]   They've got a lot of analytics over there\\n[00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.870]   You could start gathering the data and you yeah a lot of it is you don't need a lot of it\\n[00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.950]   But there may just the problem is\\n[00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:28.350]   If you don't digest it you won't you may be missing that nugget that diamond and the rough that you're go\\n[00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.510]   Oh, damn. That's a freaking amazing idea that I should have I should have done\\n[00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.030]   But because you didn't see the whole thing or at least get the bullet point list\\n[00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:40.990]   You know throw it throw the pdf into chat gbt and just say summarizes for me. Give me the give me the right\\n[00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.050]   down I did that before when Stripe sends out all their nonsense PDFs I just throw them in there\\n[00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.650]   and I'm like all right give me the top three like bullet points because I don't have time to\\n[00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:54.170]   scour 40 pages I just want to know like what's the big deal hey reduce your your time to check\\n[00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:59.690]   out hey reduce the the latency on this the time to first you know content paint you know I mean\\n[00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:05.450]   like there's so many different um you know advice out there but it really has to it really stems\\n[00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:11.690]   with identifying what issue you're struggling with first and then from there you extrapolate the\\n[00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.890]   rest of the data that comes in you know based on the you know whichever data you're funneling\\n[00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:21.530]   that's a great framework like identify the pain point that you have as much as you can\\n[00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:26.010]   and then kind of I love the idea that you mentioned like chat with PDF because we just talked about\\n[00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:30.330]   this as you know one of those things that is is being built on top of all these platform but\\n[00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:36.170]   it's useful right if you have a prompt if you have a question that you need answered as clear or\\n[00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:41.450]   fuzzy as it might be you just throw it into the system the system the LLM will think about it in\\n[00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.290]   context of this information and pull out what you need it's like your personal research\\n[00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:51.370]   assistant that is really cool it's definitely going to replace a lot of jobs I mean as as someone\\n[00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:58.410]   who's actively looking to buy and acquire businesses right now SaaS businesses like under like a quarter\\n[00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:02.970]   million right so I'm not looking for you know another three million dollar project to purchase\\n[00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:07.130]   or whatever but if I buy two or three quarter million dollar projects they're they're going to\\n[00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:10.410]   be you know they're going to be running they're going to be functional but to be honest on the\\n[00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:16.970]   marketplaces and I belong to a lot of them it's just like every third business is now an AI\\n[00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:22.730]   rapper with like a tailwind rapper and an open AI or a board call like kind of thing and it's like\\n[00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.330]   all right but how many of these are there and how many people are they going to replace\\n[00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.770]   and so then that kind of makes you look for the future and you go okay well what's\\n[00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:35.370]   what's something that's not replaceable by AI right now when I'm talking about SaaS-wise not\\n[00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:40.090]   you know obviously you know plumbers or electricians or something I'm talking about right now\\n[00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:47.210]   what is AI going to have a difficulty with content they go it goes pretty pretty good with\\n[00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:54.730]   content right now you know so the problem is what identifying that I'm a firm believer of\\n[00:40:54.730 --> 00:41:01.690]   marketplaces I think marketplaces even though they're difficult to scale and you know do well\\n[00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:07.610]   I think marketplaces and AI can't really replicate replicate that that well because you've got the\\n[00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:14.570]   buy side you've got the sell side there's no real you know way to content or optimize for that you\\n[00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:21.690]   need both so I feel like marketplaces are one you know there's you know brands specific brands\\n[00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:26.570]   I mean you could make brands with AI but they're they're not as good quality I think right now\\n[00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:31.930]   so there's a lot to it so what I what I hear you say is that in in looking for things to buy or\\n[00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:38.730]   invest in you look for things where AI is not the main dish AI is a you know a facilitator for\\n[00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:44.730]   something that is so uniquely human I guess that an artificial thing cannot do it that is I think\\n[00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:49.610]   that's an interesting and important point going forward building businesses right that is if you\\n[00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.330]   rely on AI as the thing and you don't have control of it because I've been building you\\n[00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:59.290]   know the podcast thing that's you so carefully mentioned earlier which I really appreciate about\\n[00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:04.970]   that is all local right I'm running this on my own computer like this AI is owned by me I don't\\n[00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:10.810]   have to pay open AI anything to do this or license it or whatever in in the future there will be\\n[00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:15.930]   work that cannot be done on local machines because it's just so computationally intensive and then\\n[00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:20.570]   you depend on somebody else so is that something that you may actively avoid when looking at\\n[00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:26.650]   businesses to buy and buy or invest in I don't want to say like I'm you know avidly against it\\n[00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:34.810]   I just want to say that it's it's so easy to replicate now with AI that if you were to buy a\\n[00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:41.690]   business and yeah it's got customers and it's got you know x amount house you need some sort of\\n[00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:46.650]   moat you know that's that's a big thing that that bootstrappers talk about what's my moat\\n[00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:53.370]   what's your moat to prevent someone from being able to to look at the the um the headshot uh you\\n[00:42:53.370 --> 00:43:00.250]   know the the AI headshots how quickly did Vercel all of a sudden offer that is just a a one-click\\n[00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:06.810]   deploy option and now all of a sudden that business model is just because now it's easily deployed in\\n[00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:14.090]   one one-click yeah I guess uh what wasn't it the same with like uh like chat GPTs like the\\n[00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:19.530]   when uh open AI released their GPTs and everybody was like yeah and now all these wrappers\\n[00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:24.730]   effectively have been replicated or are easily replicated replicatable I think like I was seeing\\n[00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:29.690]   Damon Chen talking about this too because like you know chat that or what PDF.ai or whatever his\\n[00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:36.570]   product is he was like yeah sure you could replicate it somewhat as a GPT but all the things around\\n[00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:42.010]   it like all the actual integration and the you know the data analysis part and and the ease of\\n[00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:46.730]   use that I guess the job to be done workflow integration like what do I need this for right\\n[00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:53.450]   that stuff that is where SaaS really shines SaaS is the integrator of things and one of the things\\n[00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:58.410]   can be AI but to make the whole thing about AI I guess that's also that's the risky part right\\n[00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:03.530]   right the the risky part is if you're building a tool versus building on top of\\n[00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.890]   AI yes because that that I think is the the risk there because yeah listen you could turn around\\n[00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:14.730]   and build another AI tweet generator or AI tweet require I mean how many of those are out there\\n[00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:20.970]   now I mean within the past two months I feel like I've seen at least 10 pop up and so I'm like okay\\n[00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:26.890]   how many of obviously the mode is not there because you've got every everybody in there you\\n[00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:31.290]   know their brother making one and they they cut they they're able to make a Chrome extension in\\n[00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:36.250]   five minutes and you know the AI integration takes you know no no time at all so it's like okay\\n[00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:41.210]   why would I buy something like that I mean you know there's really no purpose because\\n[00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:46.170]   even if you train the model okay I could train it differently too it's still something that just\\n[00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:51.930]   can be easily accessed now if you were to have a business that is let's say using you know pie\\n[00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:59.210]   torch or something that's you know that you have to customly custom build to edit a video on the fly\\n[00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.450]   or something like that yeah AI can do it but it's a little bit more complex a little more integrated\\n[00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:10.650]   so I think getting something you know making your mode as you know as deep and as wide as possible\\n[00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:16.090]   to make it to fend off potential poachers and competitors is going to be one of the keys\\n[00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:20.170]   that's something I think a lot about with my own projects as well right this this whole what is\\n[00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:26.010]   the mode for this because technology is it's not only that that it's easy to build stuff right that's\\n[00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:32.490]   for code or you can build anything if you just put your mind to it but even AI as a tool to help\\n[00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:39.850]   you build like the was a githubs co-pilot and the AI code builders now like I can literally\\n[00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:44.650]   enough and do this as I code just ask the thing a question and it comes with the full\\n[00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:50.330]   functionally working code that I could just put in and it works like and if I can do this everybody\\n[00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:57.370]   can do this right like everything is easier some people they're like oh I have pre-written\\n[00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:02.570]   prompts that you know I've trained it just I click what I click control one and it creates\\n[00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:08.330]   a website you know like oh my god like how is this gonna be in the future yeah and that's the\\n[00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:13.290]   thing like this this technology is like what two years old at max that blows my mind as well like\\n[00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:19.610]   we have already integrated these things that this AI as a helping tool as an assistant as a\\n[00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:24.890]   foundation of our businesses and the technology and in its public state I know opening eyes like\\n[00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:30.730]   nine years old or even even older than this but there the chat GPT-3 was the big thing and 3.5\\n[00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:36.330]   and 4 now and open five soon right there's this GPT-5 that's gonna be it's gonna be even crazier\\n[00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:42.650]   than four which was already crazy like this stuff is coming so fast at us that I often when you take\\n[00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:48.970]   take the the visual of the moat I always thinking about you know this this just a castle and there's\\n[00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:54.970]   a moat around it now it feels like you don't even have time to just get in there with your spade\\n[00:46:54.970 --> 00:47:00.570]   and and get the moat built before the moat is already like drowned it's already like they don't\\n[00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:05.130]   have the time to even build the moat before new technology is overtaken that's so crazy I think\\n[00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:10.170]   the issue is you have to identify the moat prior to building I think that's that that's one of the\\n[00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.530]   big things because if you just go into this going I'm just gonna build this\\n[00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:19.370]   I think you go well how can I prevent someone else from taking it oh what I love about the podcast\\n[00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:26.570]   thing is yeah someone could replicate that pretty easily but once you've got those transcripts\\n[00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:33.370]   they would have to spend the time and energy and hours to get that data as well so now they would\\n[00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:38.490]   also have to build it and scrape it from you so now you're adding an extra layer of difficulty for\\n[00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:43.370]   them to to do something so it and then the value becomes in hey we've got a database\\n[00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:48.730]   of five million podcasts how crazy is that and that is already valuable right the database\\n[00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:55.130]   itself has value exactly and every day that it runs the database gains more value and adds to the\\n[00:47:55.130 --> 00:48:01.690]   moat so that is a in and of itself you know and like having an API or having something\\n[00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:09.770]   that gate keeps not just the feature set but the actual information is value in and of itself\\n[00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:13.370]   animal well thanks for validating my business ideas I really appreciate it\\n[00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:18.330]   now it's really cool and and let me validate yours because I think your youtube channel and\\n[00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.130]   the work that you're going to be doing on on there at youtube at\\n[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:51.060]   SaaS which is hilarious and wonderful. I'm really looking forward to this because I think like let's just say with the it's not the cancellation but you know the the stopping of the indie hackers podcast which is one of the biggest podcasts in our space that just doesn't release new episodes anymore because its founders have other things to do build a community that takes a lot of time and work as well. I think our our space the indie hacker technical or not doesn't really matter like anybody who wants to build a business that is\\n[00:48:51.060 --> 00:49:21.020]   theirs that space deserves more content that caters to their curiosity to the need to connect with founders to the need to see other people's work and I love all three of these right you have the the educational the advice stuff from your own journey you have the interviews where people can feel more connected to other founders and feel less alone in the journey and then they can also see other products and other things that they don't care about it's not their their vertical or whatever it is not their niche they just don't care but they care that something exists for that and they can learn.\\n[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:50.940]   Learn from that they can learn about how do you access design how design works how features are prioritized roadmaps about I love this kind of stuff so I'm really really looking forward to you making this happen and if you need any help I'm here I can help you with this stuff as well we prior to this at me hitting the record button we were like 15 minutes into designing a studio and sound proofing it all of this stuff there obviously are better resources than me because I'm also just an amateur in this but hey I'm happy to extend helping hand here.\\n[00:49:50.940 --> 00:50:15.980]   Absolutely and the other thing about the YouTube channel for the the reviews of the tools and the reviews of the SaaS products by the founders one they'll love getting the review of their product that it's going to be glowing but to people who are watching it may not even know that something like that exists and goes yes yeah let me go check that out because you don't there's tools like I didn't even know about century and century I owe if you.\\n[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:42.780]   I'm using it for pot land and for my new project prior to thinking something like that I'm like oh my god this is this is amazing and so it's not like it's a why I mean it is it's a big product now but back then it was not that like not that well known and if you find something that you go oh that's a fantastic idea it could use it for my business just like metabase just like hot jar just like I mean there's so many tools out there that could optimize your I mean it's yeah.\\n[00:50:42.780 --> 00:51:12.740]   Now that you mentioned this I guess today I was having a conversation on Twitter asking like where should I log my my error logs for my for my application pot line as it's running because I wanted to a cheaper place than you know the enterprise solutions that charge you like thousands of dollars a year I don't want to do this with a butcher product project and somebody showed me a product like flair which is built for for their applications like mine that I could just plug in and I did took me like two minutes now have a logging solution for 10 bucks a month I didn't know that existed I almost paid 700 dollars per year.\\n[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:42.660]   And now I'm paying 70 or like 120 it's it makes it makes such a big difference just to share these things the little things on the tech stack and in the implementation side tiny little pieces of knowledge though that's all we that's all we need right sometimes just a little push just and I just a little here's a breadcrumb and you call your own trail really what it is this is amazing like I didn't even think that this could be used for my product and that's hopefully what I plan to do with at SAS on YouTube is just kind of just make it a\\n[00:51:42.660 --> 00:52:02.340]   a place for everything sas I have to say yeah I think it's I think it should be good and coming you know probably next month of the month after just because I still got to build the studio this this roommate this roommate it I mean this is it's an echo chamber there's you know I need to be sweating when\\n[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:31.660]   I know you know just movie lights from the fifties yeah that's right well you'll figure it out that's the thing like when I started I was like in the worst possible corner of my unfinished basement and I had like probably also the worst choices and lighting the worst choices in everything worst Mike worst camera I was using like not even a good phone I was just using that the crappiest little thing it all works out because the\\n[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:59.460]   idea is more important than funny enough more important than the execution in the beginning at least is the idea when it comes to media right if people get value from what you share you could be like filming it through a potato they would still watch it because the idea it's it's the content that matters and that being said if people would like to follow you on your journey and I already mentioned your sas handle on YouTube a couple times but if they wanted to follow you in particular as a founder and your other projects where should they go.\\n[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:14.620]   So the best place would just find me on X I mean and that's at Spence Patterson I couldn't get the R because someone else had that already but I have it so now all my I uniformly changes all my handles on LinkedIn and everything to be at Spence Patterson.\\n[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:26.260]   So I've gone by that name before so I'll just I guess that's how I'm going to be referred to now in the future so at Spence Patterson on X that's what's better said on LinkedIn however you want to connect to me.\\n[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:38.580]   I would love to hear about founders journeys because I am going to be building a YouTube community and and doing videos and also if you have a project that is really interesting like you know a podcast scraper or something like that.\\n[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:48.420]   You know I would love to invest as well if it's if it's something that's in the vertical that I'm comfortable with or if it's you know something that's just unique and groundbreaking.\\n[00:53:48.820 --> 00:54:01.620]   Hey what what could a little runway help with in terms of scale you know and growth and also some advice from someone who's done it before so yeah my new title I guess it'll just be investors slash influencer.\\n[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:15.060]   I gotta say like if you that that's the thing with being an educator like an educator wants to influence right you want to influence in the best possible way the people that you're trying to educate.\\n[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:34.180]   And if you're a teacher on YouTube on on X on or Twitter as with the one traditionalist would call it wherever you go if if you consider your work to be impactful influence teaching whatever it is then calling yourself an influencer is fine there we're not into by taking selfies with we are sitting in our.\\n[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:39.420]   Mostly not soundproof rooms trying to help other people build businesses I think that's perfectly fine.\\n[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:52.780]   I think it's great because I think a lot of people are in the same non soundproof rooms going how exactly right how do I get my business to wear both of them have gotten it before and that's that's the goal is to be able to help other people escape that.\\n[00:54:52.780 --> 00:55:04.860]   That kind of societal chains of you know trading time for money and I think that that's really if we could get more people to stop trading their time for money I think that would it would make the world a better place.\\n[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:22.100]   And that's coming from an ex-day trader so you know right thank you so much for being on the show that was a very insightful and very hopeful positive conversation I really appreciate it Spencer thank you so much thank you so much for having me on I appreciate I look forward to next time as well absolutely.\\n[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:28.500]   And that's it for today I will now briefly thank my sponsor acquired calm.\\n[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:41.940]   Imagine this you are founder who's built a really solid zas product you acquired all those customers and everything is generating really consistent monthly recurring revenue that's the dream of every zas founder right.\\n[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:52.420]   Problem is you're not growing for whatever reason maybe it's like a skill or a lack of focus or play in like of interest you don't know you just feel stuck in your business with your business.\\n[00:55:52.940 --> 00:56:12.780]   What should you do well the story that I would like to hear is that you buckle down you reignited the fire and you started working on the business not just in the business and all those things you did like audience building and marketing and sales and outreach they really helped you to go down this road six months on the road making all that money.\\n[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:17.820]   You travel to your revenue and you have this hyper successful business that is the dream.\\n[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:33.340]   The reality unfortunately is not as simple as this and the situation that you might find yourself in is looking different for every single founder who's facing this cross road this problem is common but it looks different every time but what doesn't look different every time is the story that.\\n[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:43.580]   Here just ends up being one of inaction and stagnation because the business becomes less and less valuable over time and then eventually completely worthless if you don't do anything so if you find yourself here.\\n[00:56:43.780 --> 00:57:00.500]   Already at this point we think your stories likely had a down a similar road I would consider a third option and that is selling a business on a quiet calm because you capitalizing on the value of your time today is a pretty smart move it's really better than not doing anything and the quiet calm is free to list they've helped hundreds of\\n[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:16.900]   founders already just go check it out at try.co.com\\\/arvard me and see for yourself if this is the right option for you your business at this time you might just want to wait a bit and see if it works out half a year from now or a year from now just check it out

This episode is sponsored by Aquia.com. More on that later. Let's\\n[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800]   start with a story. Last week I talked about getting feedback from the right people. That\\n[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.000]   was the point of that episode. And I also shared my reservations about the freemium business model\\n[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.200]   for my current SaaS project, Podline. And because sometimes the stars align,\\n[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.560]   I received the voice message through Podline from Melissa, whose feedback I want to share with you\\n[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.400]   now. Hey Arvid, Justin Jackson here, just out for walk listening to your podcast,\\n[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:50.080]   is freemium a good option for Bootstrappers? Well, I mean, there are no universal laws in\\n[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:59.360]   Bootstrapping. It can be a good approach. And in your case, I think with a tool like voice mail\\n[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   for podcasters, voice memos for podcasters, I think it might be the best approach, simply because\\n[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.920]   a lot of podcasters don't have a lot of budget. Usually they've used up all of their budget on\\n[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.560]   podcast hosting, microphone, and maybe investing in some podcast editing. And so in the beginning,\\n[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   there might just not be a lot of budget left over for a tool like this. But if you can get them\\n[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.720]   using it and loving it, as their podcast grows, they might be willing to pay for it, especially\\n[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.160]   if it becomes one of their favorite parts of doing the show. One of the challenges with podcasts is\\n[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.960]   you don't get a lot of feedback from your listeners. So if Podline gives podcasters\\n[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.680]   some response, they get to hear back from their listeners, and they really enjoy that,\\n[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.440]   they might be willing to pay for it in the future. So I think it's an experiment worth trying.\\n[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:09.120]   Thanks, Justin. This is incredibly appreciated and definitely an experiment I am willing to run.\\n[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.800]   Getting this message from one of my favorite founders, make me think about the role that\\n[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.720]   influential experts like Justin play in my professional life. I've read Justin's book on\\n[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.640]   marketing for developers. I read his newsletter whenever it appears in my inbox, and I listen to his\\n[00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:57.070]   asked about building transistors. And the thoughts struck me, Justin is an influencer in the best sense of the word. Forget the glamorous, selfie-taking Dubai resident kind of in front. So that's not what I mean. Justin helps ambitious founders like myself with his perspective. He influences how we weigh our options, what ideas we follow, and when we change direction. The one thing that Justin and many other amazingly strong,\\n[00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.670]   supportive people in the field like him provide is context. Look at my example. I was wondering if a\\n[00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.110]   polarizing business model choice was a good idea for myself for business, trying to serve the podcast\\n[00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.230]   creator industry. I was thinking about freemium, right? Is that right or is it not? Now, Justin lives in\\n[00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.870]   that podcast industry. He provides a core service to many such creators in sharing his thoughts about\\n[00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.350]   budgetary constraints and challenges that my future customers regularly face, just in contextualized\\n[00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.990]   the discussion around freemium to my actual business scope. And even the selfie-taking Instagram\\n[00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.190]   inferences out there do something very similar. Every product review, every reaction video,\\n[00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.030]   and every photo of a location serves as a context bridge for the people who follow them.\\n[00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.990]   Seth Golden has this phrase, people like us do things like this, which he uses to describe the\\n[00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.990]   tribal nature of groups, audiences or customers or whatever brings people together. Group members\\n[00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.950]   value internal alignment, reliable expectations that's part of it too, and similarities. Even\\n[00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.630]   anarchists want to hang out with other anarchists. That's how tribes, that's how groups work.\\n[00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.750]   Less alignment used to be much easier to accomplish in the past when proximity was to norm in pre-digital\\n[00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.430]   times. The mere fact that people interacted with each other regularly, that's the important part,\\n[00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.870]   in a physical space, also important, provided a significant amount of context to everyone in this\\n[00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.230]   group. You would get to know people not just by something as transient like that Twitter avatar,\\n[00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.830]   but you would actually feel their presence. You'd subconsciously notice with whom and how they\\n[00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.190]   interact, and you would see quite quickly just how much you had in common, which most of the\\n[00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.430]   time was quite a lot. That is missing now, because this built-in benefit of hanging out due to a\\n[00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.110]   shared interest, it explains...\\n[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.460]   Since why we still love to go to in-person conferences and meetups, even though we could\\n[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.580]   do it all virtually, humans want clarity, connection, and most of all, context.\\n[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.980]   And just as the shallow world of social media destroys a lot of that context, the influencer\\n[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.200]   role emerged to re-establish it.\\n[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.980]   It's not surprising, really.\\n[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.860]   Some people spend more time nerding out about particular topics than others.\\n[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.020]   They see more of the landscape, in that field, they understand the dynamics better, and they\\n[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.540]   have better insights into how things work.\\n[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.940]   These influential thinkers can categorize better than the average amateur.\\n[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.340]   This is precisely why we listen to them.\\n[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.820]   They pre-categorize and pre-value the things that we might not be so sure about.\\n[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.740]   Just like my little issue with the freemium business model, Justin Jackson has been around\\n[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.020]   the Indie Hacker space for much longer than I am.\\n[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.180]   He's seen it all and he can contextualize and categorize this broad question of, \\\"Should\\n[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.020]   I give certain things away for free?\\\"\\n[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.820]   To a very specific issue of niche interest that software businesses, owners like myself,\\n[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820]   might have.\\n[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.340]   That's his skill and that's the important part of why he is so influential.\\n[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.460]   He can help contextualize.\\n[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.780]   What does this mean for you?\\n[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.100]   You might ask at this point or over the last five minutes.\\n[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.060]   Well, if you intend to build a social media following or want to establish a personal\\n[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.420]   brand around yourself and you work to find better jobs or better business ideas and\\n[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.580]   better customers, well, then this will allow you to reframe the often-nebulous concept\\n[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.660]   of niche influence or into something that you can actually use.\\n[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.740]   It's not about presenting yourself as the foremost expert on whatever your niche is\\n[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.740]   about.\\n[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.620]   It's about helping people find context where they lack it.\\n[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.860]   Which is precisely why you can build a reputation as an expert by merely connecting newbies\\n[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.140]   with other experts and their expertise.\\n[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.860]   You don't need to be extremely original.\\n[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.140]   You can just contextualize things by collecting them and giving people frameworks that they\\n[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.620]   might not be aware about.\\n[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.940]   This is what they need.\\n[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.300]   People rarely look for truth.\\n[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.900]   We all know that for every piece of advice out there, there's this exact opposite presented\\n[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.100]   and argued just as reasonably.\\n[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.500]   But people do look for judgment, for value assignment, and for easier decision making.\\n[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.940]   Anything, and anyone who can help them determine what's useful to them in their particular\\n[00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:50.270]   circumstances at this very point will be considered someone worth following. You don't have to have the ambition of gathering hundreds of thousands of people around you, just to be influential. Just simplify things, categorize them, and share these thoughts with your peers. The more you do this, the more you will find yourself aligned with the curiosity and the respect of those around you. And these things are the most valuable things you could ever seek to find in your potential audience.\\n[00:07:50.270 --> 00:08:00.270]   And that's it for today. I want to briefly thank my sponsor, acquire.com. Since we're talking about alignment and personal brands, let's dive a little into the why behind acquire.\\n[00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:12.270]   I have had its founder, Andrew Gazadecki, on this podcast before. And when you hear Andrew talk, you find that he truly understands the why behind the founder wanting to sell their businesses.\\n[00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:25.270]   And in this conversation, the surprising part was that this why is never the same for any two founders. Some people are just plain bored with the day to day and they need to do something else. Others need to sell for financial reasons right now.\\n[00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:35.270]   And some people have new ideas or have reached their skill ceiling for every single person selling their business. On acquire, there's a new and uniquely specific reason and a story.\\n[00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:46.270]   And because of that, the acquire team works with you to figure out how just to get your business in its current state, whatever that might be on the market for a price that works for you and your future buyer.\\n[00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:59.270]   And in that way, the folks that acquire really are the influencers here, the experts in their field. And they will bridge the context gap between you and the uncertainty of what you could potentially get for your hard earned business efforts.\\n[00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:10.270]   Acquire.com, free their list. They've helped hundreds of founders already. Just go to try.acquire.com\\\/arvard and see for yourself if this is the right option for you and your business right now.\\n[00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:18.270]   I think it's always a good idea to be prepared and see what you might get out of the thing that you build with so much effort.\\n[00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:26.270]   Thank you for listening to the putser founder today. You can find me on Twitter @Avitcal, @AIVEDKHL and you find my books from my Twitter course there too.\\n[00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:32.270]   If you want to support me and to show, please subscribe to my YouTube channel and get the podcast near a player of choice.\\n[00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:38.270]   Leave a rating and a review by going to ratethispodcast.com\\\/founder that really makes a massive difference.\\n[00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.270]   Because if you show up there, then the podcast will show up in other people's feeds.\\n[00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.270]   Any of this will help the show. So thank you so much for listening.\\n[00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.270]   Have a wonderful day.\\n[00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.270]   Have a wonderful day.\",\"episode_description\":\"<p>What's more important?

for me, but it's not the only one.\\n[01:07.100 --> 01:09.700]  A very welcome one, but by far not the only one.\\n[01:09.900 --> 01:18.600]  And before I lose myself in this dream of a million dollar exit, maybe let's take a step back and look at how we can best put all the options on the table.\\n[01:18.600 --> 01:31.300]  Because the exit is only one end of the spectrum, the good kind, the one we want to think about all the time, but we need to look at its opposite too to get the full picture of what life with a business might be.\\n[01:31.700 --> 01:40.700]  Tim Ferriss often talks about fear setting, the act of imagining the worst and then understanding that even when that happens, there is a path forward.\\n[01:40.800 --> 01:42.800]  So let's start with that.\\n[01:43.400 --> 01:48.900]  I'm building a software business again, and I want to consider the risks involved as early as I can.\\n[01:49.000 --> 01:58.300]  I have some experience with this, having built one and sold one in the past, and with that level of insight and experience, I can start it differently this time around.\\n[01:58.500 --> 02:11.100]  I think it's important to know where problems may come up in the future, near future or far future and how to handle them both at that point and maybe also how I can prepare for them, avoid them.\\n[02:11.200 --> 02:19.100]  So let's think about the worst case scenarios first here, and what we do to either deal with them or better yet prevent them in the first place.\\n[02:19.600 --> 02:22.600]  In a software business, there are quite a few things that can go wrong.\\n[02:22.700 --> 02:30.300]  Obviously, there's the software part, but there's also the people part, and the most obvious problem is that nobody might want to be a customer.\\n[02:30.400 --> 02:38.700]  For example, with the part line, the business that I'm building, it would be pretty bad if nobody cared about the product, which is supposed to connect podcasters with their listeners.\\n[02:38.700 --> 02:51.200]  If neither listeners nor podcasters would care about this, or if podcasters would only use the free version and then never pay it because there wasn't any reason for them to do so, this could make the business too expensive to run, and that's a problem.\\n[02:51.400 --> 02:57.000]  As a software developer and a founder, one of the biggest fears that I have is that nobody will want what I offer.\\n[02:57.100 --> 03:02.900]  I think this is as intense a fear as for a comedian if they had nobody laughing at their jokes.\\n[03:03.000 --> 03:15.200]  I think for founders, nobody wanting your product is equal in terms of how scary it sounds, but I don't think this is such a big problem when you look at it, the business that I'm building at least, as one small bet and a portfolio of many.\\n[03:15.400 --> 03:19.900]  I think that's what pod line is for me, and it is intentionally that from the beginning.\\n[03:20.100 --> 03:28.700]  I have other things going on, I have other skills like coding and writing, and I can always work on other projects and explore new markets, new technologies, new ideas.\\n[03:29.100 --> 03:41.600]  The current running cost of pod line is in the high-ish two figures, less than $100 per month, and I don't think it's going to change any time soon, no matter how many people use the product, that's how I built it.\\n[03:41.900 --> 03:49.800]  And I think this bet can last a long while, and I could potentially create a few more just like it and still stay in my own budget.\\n[03:50.100 --> 03:57.200]  And I was talking about this with my partner, Danielle, recently, even if this product never makes any money, I think it's still a great investment.\\n[03:57.600 --> 04:07.000]  I get to build in public, I get to share this whole journey, I get to explore ideas and concepts and frameworks and teach them to people who are also willing to build something.\\n[04:07.200 --> 04:14.000]  And no matter if it succeeds massively or if it fails, there is a value in knowing how to do it, right?\\n[04:14.200 --> 04:19.400]  Not every bet pays off, but even taking the bet is already an important step.\\n[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  Beyond that, I get to work and partner with people in the industry I'm interested in, in podcasting, an industry that is seeing massive growth.\\n[04:27.200 --> 04:38.400]  So there's a lot of momentum happening, and right now, in my financial situation, this whole thing, this whole business is a pretty low cost gamble with potentially massive upside if it works.\\n[04:38.600 --> 04:45.600]  And even if nobody wants to use my product, I can still make money from the podcast that I have and the info products that I have out there.\\n[04:45.800 --> 04:55.000]  So while it's not ideal to not have customers for a product in this fear-setting potential scenario, it's not the end of the world either.\\n[04:55.000 --> 05:05.000]  If nothing ever came out of this, I would still have learned how to code with AI assistance as I've been recently exploring on this podcast and just in my work.\\n[05:05.200 --> 05:19.000]  And I still would have learned how powerful the Laravel framework and the ecosystem is and getting to know more about the business side behind that and how to write solid prompts for open AI APIs, all that stuff that's still value in this.\\n[05:19.800 --> 05:25.600]  Another fear I have is that I'm actively over estimating my ability to make money from this product.\\n[05:25.800 --> 05:31.200]  The fear here is that I'm talking to the wrong people or I'm talking to the right people, but they don't have a budget.\\n[05:31.400 --> 05:38.800]  I think I understand the challenges of podcasters well enough, but I may need to change direction and explore other tools or mediums at some point.\\n[05:38.800 --> 05:43.400]  I think that's okay with me as a fear-based scenario because I'll figure it out.\\n[05:43.600 --> 05:47.000]  I always have and I will and I don't have a short runway.\\n[05:47.200 --> 05:56.800]  So I think it is a possible reality for me to have to change things as I learn more about the people that I'm trying to serve.\\n[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  That's just a reality of running a business.\\n[05:59.200 --> 06:08.600]  But what I wanted to be is profitable from an early start because that is both validation of the market, the budget, the audience, the potential customer base, all of that.\\n[06:08.800 --> 06:10.000]  That needs to be some profitability.\\n[06:10.200 --> 06:15.200]  So what if it takes too long to generate enough revenue for this project to be sustainable?\\n[06:15.400 --> 06:16.600]  That's another scenario.\\n[06:16.800 --> 06:23.000]  I think I can handle the expenses for a while, but I do see another risk here for myself because I know myself well enough.\\n[06:23.200 --> 06:25.000]  I could become bored along the way.\\n[06:25.200 --> 06:30.200]  If there's not enough engagement by real people, why would I want to build more?\\n[06:30.400 --> 06:35.400]  Why would I focus more because if it's supposed to help people, well, what if it doesn't?\\n[06:36.000 --> 06:38.400]  Stopping to care makes projects fail.\\n[06:38.600 --> 06:44.400]  I've witnessed this in my own experience working with other people who stopped caring because they had other things going on.\\n[06:44.600 --> 06:47.400]  And if I didn't want to work on Podline,\\n[06:47.600 --> 06:53.000]  that kind of self-imposed limitation might prevent me from giving it my all, which I think every business needs.\\n[06:53.200 --> 06:55.000]  So how will I handle this?\\n[06:55.200 --> 06:59.000]  This is one of those things where if I arrive at that point, it's already too late.\\n[06:59.200 --> 07:00.400]  So I better prevent it.\\n[07:00.600 --> 07:04.800]  I will follow my own entrepreneurial advice and keep building this in public.\\n[07:04.800 --> 07:08.800]  Even though it might be painful, I'll keep communication lines open.\\n[07:09.000 --> 07:10.600]  I'll share the good and the bad.\\n[07:10.800 --> 07:16.600]  I'll engage with the community both as a founder of a business and a podcaster that is active within this community.\\n[07:16.800 --> 07:22.000]  And I will actively market and talk about the product within that community.\\n[07:22.200 --> 07:26.200]  I will partner with people, reach out, back channel, front channel, whatever it might need.\\n[07:26.400 --> 07:27.800]  I will stay engaged.\\n[07:28.000 --> 07:31.600]  I will stay with my finger on the pulse of this community.\\n[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Because I know myself.\\n[07:33.200 --> 07:36.200]  I tend to focus too much on the fun stuff, the engineering stuff.\\n[07:36.400 --> 07:39.200]  So I need to keep an eye on what I do.\\n[07:39.400 --> 07:44.000]  If I fall into complacency, I will just start coding away in my software developer\\n[07:44.200 --> 07:46.200]  basement dungeon and isolate myself.\\n[07:46.400 --> 07:47.800]  I think that's very dangerous.\\n[07:48.000 --> 07:56.000]  I know myself well enough to know that if there is some kind of potential agitation or things\\n[07:56.200 --> 08:01.400]  don't feel like they're easy, I might retract into this state and I don't want this.\\n[08:01.600 --> 08:08.200]  Instead, I will always approach this business as an involved podcaster in the middle of my community\\n[08:08.400 --> 08:11.800]  and to succeed, I need to stay connected with people.\\n[08:12.000 --> 08:15.800]  And there's one more fear I have and it's an all too likely one.\\n[08:16.000 --> 08:18.800]  Peter Neville's just posted about this earlier this week.\\n[08:19.000 --> 08:26.400]  He was talking about his usage of Mapbox for his map based hood maps tool that has become extremely expensive\\n[08:26.600 --> 08:29.200]  because he can't control how many people use it.\\n[08:29.600 --> 08:34.400]  The API key is in the front end and people could abuse it if they wanted to.\\n[08:34.600 --> 08:36.400]  And I think that's kind of what happened there.\\n[08:36.600 --> 08:40.200]  So he had to switch providers to another one that he had more control over.\\n[08:40.400 --> 08:45.000]  But there was a pretty sizable bill that he would have had to pay if it wasn't for Mapbox\\n[08:45.200 --> 08:47.200]  who said that's fine, you don't have to pay this.\\n[08:47.400 --> 08:49.800]  I think that's my biggest financial fear with this project.\\n[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  We're seeing that not making any money because if everything becomes extremely expensive due to a mistake that I might make,\\n[08:56.000 --> 09:03.800]  I might actively lose money on something that by default shouldn't cost me more than a hundred bucks a month.\\n[09:04.000 --> 09:06.800]  And at Podline, I'm working with external dependencies.\\n[09:07.000 --> 09:08.600]  Like OpenAI talked about this, right?\\n[09:08.800 --> 09:14.800]  The APIs that I use for my summarization and transcription of the voice messages that go through Podline.\\n[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  And there's file hosting because those voice messages, the MP3s and the way files they need to live somewhere.\\n[09:20.200 --> 09:25.000]  So I pay for these services which charge per API call or per file hosted.\\n[09:25.000 --> 09:37.000]  So there's a risk that someone could abuse the platform that I build and cause financial damage by creating a lot of data or using the AI features excessively and uncontrollably.\\n[09:37.200 --> 09:49.600]  So to prepare for this, I need to make it as hard as possible to abuse, obviously, but I also need alerts in place for each platform that I use to ensure that I don't spend more than what I want to spend in a month.\\n[09:49.600 --> 09:56.600]  And I also need to protect my credentials, like the example with Peter, where it was impossible to protect them.\\n[09:56.800 --> 10:09.600]  I don't think that's the case for me, but I need to protect them even more than making sure that those credentials, the API keys and whatnot, don't leak from my server or ever appear in my code or screenshots or anything like this.\\n[10:09.800 --> 10:17.800]  I have to be really careful having a quick way to invalidating these credentials is pretty crucial for me at this point to maintain operational security.\\n[10:17.800 --> 10:29.800]  And since I have these alerts, the payment alerts already set up, all I need to do now is to make sure that I read the alert emails when they come in and have a plan in place to cycle credentials in a crunch to quickly do this.\\n[10:30.000 --> 10:46.800]  I tend to write SOPs for these kind of things, like really step by steps, click this link, log into AWS, click this link, click on the cycle credential button or delete credential, whatever the step by step to make it very easy for myself to execute when I need to.\\n[10:46.800 --> 10:52.800]  So I don't make a mistake along the way, and I know exactly what login and what password to use, that kind of stuff.\\n[10:53.000 --> 11:04.400]  And if I'm not here for this to be able to give somebody else that SOP and the relevant credentials to be able to log in and do this for me real quick is also important.\\n[11:04.600 --> 11:13.000]  So I have structured secret SOPs, I guess, that I use for myself and if somebody else needs to help me, I can quickly give them.\\n[11:13.000 --> 11:21.000]  I have this, I think, in Notion. I usually do this in Notion because that's quickly shareable if I need to, but yeah, be prepared, that's really what it is.\\n[11:21.200 --> 11:23.000]  So yeah, those are my fears.\\n[11:23.200 --> 11:28.600]  And I think this has been a number of different kind of fears, right?\\n[11:28.800 --> 11:32.600]  There are many, many different things that our business could go wrong.\\n[11:32.800 --> 11:41.400]  It could become too expensive, it might not generate revenue, it could get boring, but I have mitigation plans and avoidance strategies for each of these.\\n[11:41.400 --> 11:46.200]  So next, let's explore the positive outcomes here.\\n[11:46.400 --> 11:50.400]  While still considering their costs, I think this is important for this exercise.\\n[11:50.600 --> 12:01.000]  You have to look at what the good path might be, but there still is cost involved for each of these wonderful scenarios, even the exit, if we think about it, right?\\n[12:01.200 --> 12:07.800]  Somebody else is paying you a lot of money, but to get there and to keep building value, that involves something.\\n[12:07.800 --> 12:15.800]  Because it's important to think that most people want to be entrepreneurs for freedom, financial security and the ability to do what they want.\\n[12:16.000 --> 12:23.800]  Achieving this requires lots of time and effort to be able to create this extraordinary value that others will pay millions for.\\n[12:24.000 --> 12:34.600]  This is kind of where selling your business comes in, right? Through platforms like Acquire or Business Brokers or private equity companies to create that value that other people are going to give you a couple million for.\\n[12:34.600 --> 12:43.600]  You need to spend a lot of time working hard and engaging with others in your community, and that is time not spent on anything or anyone else.\\n[12:43.800 --> 12:45.400]  That's important to know.\\n[12:45.600 --> 12:54.600]  Let's imagine an amazingly positive scenario where a pod line gains lots of customers and within a few months we have thousands of dollars in monthly recurring revenue.\\n[12:54.800 --> 13:01.800]  It's likely a high retention product, since I hope that it becomes part of a podcast routine to have people call in and send voice messages.\\n[13:01.800 --> 13:07.200]  Let's just say retention is high, churn is low, and it just keeps growing and growing. Ideal scenario, right?\\n[13:07.400 --> 13:12.600]  How much time should I spend on this? What about customer service or adding new features?\\n[13:12.800 --> 13:20.000]  Is there a limit even to the scope of this business? Could it grow into something much bigger or should it stay in its little niche?\\n[13:20.200 --> 13:28.600]  Will it always be a side project or could it become a full-time job? Should it become a full-time job and how will it affect my time for other things?\\n[13:28.600 --> 13:32.600]  Like my podcast, my newsletter, building my online brand, my family?\\n[13:32.800 --> 13:38.200]  I mean, I said that Christmas is a time for reflection. Well, reflect, I did.\\n[13:38.400 --> 13:46.600]  And right now, I don't want pod line to be a full-time project, which might be surprising because most founders want their projects to be the thing.\\n[13:46.800 --> 13:58.400]  They want to be able to quit their job and work on their own SaaS, or they want to go like 80 hours a week full-time grind mode to build a massive business to then sell it a couple of years down the road and become millionaires.\\n[13:59.600 --> 14:07.600]  Well, that's an interesting potential opportunity in the future, but I think for at least another year, I would like this to be a part-time thing.\\n[14:07.800 --> 14:14.400]  Half-time, really. I want to spend no more than 20 hours a week on pod line, including customer service and marketing.\\n[14:14.600 --> 14:23.600]  And although I've automated a lot of tasks already, I still want time for my media business and most importantly, my family, all of this needs to happen still while pod link grows.\\n[14:23.600 --> 14:28.600]  I became an entrepreneur, so I could have flexibility in my schedule and spend time with loved ones.\\n[14:28.800 --> 14:31.600]  I wanted agency and autonomy.\\n[14:31.800 --> 14:38.600]  In the past, I spent too much time building software businesses and that hurt my physical health and my relationships along the way.\\n[14:38.800 --> 14:41.600]  I don't want to repeat that, mostly because I don't have to.\\n[14:41.800 --> 14:45.600]  It was different back then. I had to kind of grind it out to see why it was going good.\\n[14:45.800 --> 14:48.600]  Right now, I am in a different situation.\\n[14:48.600 --> 14:54.600]  Pod line is a simple software service project and it shouldn't get in the way of me being with my family.\\n[14:54.800 --> 15:01.600]  And even if the business does well, spending time with my people is more important than making pod line with full-time business.\\n[15:01.800 --> 15:04.600]  At least not a solopreneurial one. That's the thing, right?\\n[15:04.800 --> 15:10.600]  I can have a business that doesn't need me to work all the time and still brings in good income.\\n[15:10.800 --> 15:11.600]  That would be perfect.\\n[15:11.800 --> 15:16.600]  I'd consider hiring somebody else to handle the daily operations, like a CEO of that business.\\n[15:16.600 --> 15:19.600]  While I stay involved as the founder, owner, and board member.\\n[15:19.800 --> 15:26.600]  But full-time SaaS, plus a media business, plus all the other things, and then having time for family, that's not happening.\\n[15:26.800 --> 15:32.600]  So, what is the best possible long-term outcome here?\\n[15:32.800 --> 15:34.600]  Well, there are two options for me.\\n[15:34.800 --> 15:39.600]  One is to keep owning the business and have a generate steady income without too much effort on my part.\\n[15:39.800 --> 15:43.200]  It's kind of the autopilot with slight improvements over time.\\n[15:43.200 --> 15:45.200]  It just keeps running and chugging along.\\n[15:45.400 --> 15:53.200]  Ideally, it would bring in a mid-5-figure monthly recurring revenue, just like feedback Panda did my previous business to be sold in 2019 for,\\n[15:53.400 --> 15:59.200]  well, not allowed to disclose it, but we were making around $50,000 in monthly recurring revenue.\\n[15:59.400 --> 16:03.200]  If it reaches this level this time, I would probably not sell at this point.\\n[16:03.400 --> 16:07.200]  I would keep this business running for as long as I can.\\n[16:07.400 --> 16:12.200]  But if pod line grows into a six-figure monthly recurring revenue business,\\n[16:12.200 --> 16:14.200]  I might think about selling it.\\n[16:14.400 --> 16:19.200]  My magic number for selling would probably be in the mid-7 figures, a couple million.\\n[16:19.400 --> 16:27.200]  And with pod line helping potentially thousands of podcasts connect with millions of their listeners, that's quite possible to reach.\\n[16:27.400 --> 16:36.200]  I'd consider selling this business once it reaches maybe 80 to 100k MRR, and then, you know, then the negotiation started and it keeps growing anyway.\\n[16:36.400 --> 16:40.200]  But, yeah, if it's six figures a month, I could see selling this.\\n[16:40.200 --> 16:46.200]  But until then, it'll be a great source of income for me, provided that it does great income, right?\\n[16:46.400 --> 16:49.200]  That's why this is the positive side of this exercise.\\n[16:49.400 --> 16:54.400]  Obviously, this suggests that there are customers that are willing to pay for this, that I find the right price point.\\n[16:54.600 --> 17:00.200]  I find the right way to position the business and communicate the value and keep them engaged and nurture them and all of that, right?\\n[17:00.400 --> 17:03.200]  That's happening. I'm looking at beyond that.\\n[17:03.400 --> 17:09.200]  I could then reinvest some of that money into the business, keep growing, hire people to work for me and turn it into a full-time project.\\n[17:09.200 --> 17:15.200]  For someone else, maybe myself, but that's future talk right now, I don't want that.\\n[17:15.400 --> 17:19.200]  And this way, I could spend more time with the people that I care about.\\n[17:19.400 --> 17:30.200]  As I approach 40 years of age, I don't want to waste time on tasks that others can do or want to do and things that don't add value over time.\\n[17:30.400 --> 17:36.200]  I want everything that I do to have a cumulative effect and help me create the lifestyle I desire.\\n[17:36.200 --> 17:43.200]  Because that's what this is, running a profitable lifestyle business, a calm and intentional, profitable lifestyle business.\\n[17:43.400 --> 17:47.200]  That's what I want to do, something that allows me to live life on my terms.\\n[17:47.400 --> 17:53.400]  And I think this is enough for me. Owning and operating such a business would be my ideal outcome.\\n[17:53.600 --> 17:58.200]  That's what I project. That's what I want to manifest with this exercise, right?\\n[17:58.400 --> 18:02.800]  What is the thing I actually want to build? Because I could build all things, right?\\n[18:02.800 --> 18:05.800]  I could build a business that makes no money. It's pretty easy.\\n[18:06.000 --> 18:07.600]  Just build it and then nobody will come.\\n[18:07.800 --> 18:12.800]  Or I could build a business that makes massive amounts of money and have to hire like whole teams of people.\\n[18:13.000 --> 18:15.800]  But do I want that? I don't think so.\\n[18:16.000 --> 18:21.800]  What I want is a lifestyle business that slowly and calmly grows profitably.\\n[18:22.000 --> 18:26.200]  And then I want to see where this goes, but I don't want to overdo it either way.\\n[18:26.400 --> 18:31.800]  So as the year nears its end, these are my thoughts on running a software business.\\n[18:31.800 --> 18:38.800]  I hope this exercise allowed you to glimpse into the mind of someone who's been there and still chooses to do it once again.\\n[18:39.000 --> 18:43.800]  And if you think I missed anything here, any scenario that you felt I should address\\n[18:44.000 --> 18:48.200]  or that you had in your own experience or that you fear for your own journey,\\n[18:48.400 --> 18:54.000]  let me know. Send me a message using Podline.picool at podline.fm slash Arvid.\\n[18:54.200 --> 18:55.800]  I would really appreciate that.\\n[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  And if you want me to answer any other question that you have on the show,\\n[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  I would love that too. Podline.fm slash Arvid. And that's it for today.\\n[19:04.200 --> 19:07.800]  I want to briefly thank my sponsor, Acquire.com.\\n[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  Let's keep imagining things.\\n[19:10.200 --> 19:14.000]  Let's imagine your founder who's built this really cool SaaS product.\\n[19:14.200 --> 19:16.400]  Podline, let's use Podline as an example.\\n[19:16.600 --> 19:20.200]  We have acquired customers and we're generating really consistent MRR.\\n[19:20.400 --> 19:22.000]  We are living the SaaS dream.\\n[19:22.200 --> 19:28.600]  Problem is, at some point, there's a lack of focus, a lack of skill or just like a lack of interest.\\n[19:28.600 --> 19:33.400]  You just feel stuck running this business or I feel stuck running this business.\\n[19:33.600 --> 19:34.600]  What should I do?\\n[19:34.800 --> 19:39.800]  Well, the problem is that everybody tells me that I should buckle down and reignite the fire,\\n[19:40.000 --> 19:44.400]  get to work and build something that six months down the road makes all that money.\\n[19:44.600 --> 19:46.400]  I triple your revenue, that kind of thing.\\n[19:46.600 --> 19:51.600]  But reality is, in that moment, unfortunately not the case.\\n[19:51.800 --> 19:55.600]  The situation that I'm facing there is so difficult and every founder who's facing\\n[19:55.600 --> 19:58.600]  this has a different scenario that they're looking into.\\n[19:58.800 --> 20:03.400]  But too many times for all founders who have this problem, the business is great.\\n[20:03.600 --> 20:05.400]  It's running, but it's not growing anymore.\\n[20:05.600 --> 20:10.600]  Well, the story here ends up being one of inaction or stagnation because they don't know what to do.\\n[20:10.800 --> 20:16.400]  Until the business declines, it becomes less and less valuable over time or worse completely worthless.\\n[20:16.600 --> 20:22.800]  So if I would find myself here or you find yourself here or you think your story is headed down this road,\\n[20:23.000 --> 20:30.600]  I would think about selling this business on acquired.com because I understand that the value of my time as a founder is extremely valuable.\\n[20:30.800 --> 20:35.600]  Capitalizing on this is a good idea and listing my business on acquire is free.\\n[20:35.800 --> 20:38.200]  They've helped hundreds of founders already in the past.\\n[20:38.400 --> 20:40.200]  So why would I not?\\n[20:40.400 --> 20:47.400]  I mean, it's anonymous and I could see what people offer just to see what the value is that I could get for it right now.\\n[20:47.600 --> 20:51.200]  Still better than nothing and still better than having something that declines.\\n[20:51.200 --> 20:56.600]  So go to try it at acquired.com slash Arvid and see for yourself if this is the right option for you,\\n[20:56.800 --> 20:58.600]  your business at this point in time.\\n[20:58.800 --> 21:03.000]  It never hurts to be prepared and you can always learn something from the process,\\n[21:03.200 --> 21:06.000]  which I guess for founders is what we do anyway.\\n[21:06.200 --> 21:07.400]  So why not list?\\n[21:07.600 --> 21:10.200]  Thank you so much for listening to the boot tip founder today.\\n[21:10.400 --> 21:14.200]  You can find me on Twitter at Avidcon ARVIDKAAHL.\\n[21:14.400 --> 21:17.800]  If I'm at books on my Twitter course that too and if you want to support me on this show,\\n[21:17.800 --> 21:21.000]  please subscribe to my YouTube channel, get this podcast in your podcast,\\n[21:21.200 --> 21:26.000]  play off choice and leave a five star rating and review by going to rate this podcast.com\\n[21:26.200 --> 21:30.200]  slash founder and then finding the platform that you listen to podcasts on.\\n[21:30.400 --> 21:33.600]  This makes a massive difference because if you show up there,\\n[21:33.800 --> 21:37.800]  then the podcast will show up in people's feeds and that is really appreciated.\\n[21:38.000 --> 21:39.800]  Any of this will help the show.\\n[21:40.000 --> 21:44.200]  Thank you so much for listening and have a wonderful day and bye bye.\\n[21:44.200 --> 21:49.000]  And I guess it's not time for Happy New Year yet, but happy holidays.\\nTranscription results written to '\\\/home\\\/forge\\\/transcribe3.sonicengage.com\\\/releases\\\/20240207165123' directory\",\"episode_description\":\"<p>The holidays are a season when our priorities clash particularly often.

I have a not so hyped yet AI topic for you today. We live in a day and age where using AI on our own servers has become possible. And I think that is magnificent. I will explain to you why. As a business owner and a software entrepreneur, I think that is just as interesting as it is important to consider setting up systems on our own back ends instead of relying on hosted platforms and APIs. That's just platform risk, right? And up until now, AI has been one of the most\\n[00:30.000 --> 01:00.000]  things that you only get on somebody else's platform. If you're a software founder interested in using AI technology without depending on someone else's unit economics, this is for you today. We'll dive into running your own chat GPT replacement for fun and more importantly, I guess, for profit. Now, I've been tinkering with this kind of tech over the last couple of weeks to great success. So in the spirit of building in public, why not tell you what and how I did. In my latest SaaS, Potsk,\\n[01:00.000 --> 01:30.000]  I use two kinds of artificial intelligence. The first one is an audio to text transcription system called Whisper. And there's an LLM, a large language model like chat GPT that generates responses based on prompts. The transcription system is pretty cool, but it's not something that every software entrepreneur needs because it's really specific to converting audio into text. And audio is niche medium for most of us. But I would say all software founders work with text data in some shape or form somewhere in a database.\\n[01:30.000 --> 02:00.000]  Customer records, notes, instructions, it's all text. And founders got very excited back in the day when chat GPT came out, which now, I guess, is two years ago, which in terms of our industry is really just a blip, right? But still, people got super excited. All of a sudden, particularly once we could access that kind of service through an API, we could build on top of these amazingly smart language models. And that pioneering spirit has brought us to an interesting inflection point, because the open, in open AI, the company needs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able\\n[02:00.000 --> 02:29.320]  to need that spearhead it, the whole chat GPT and all the GPT systems. That has been a catalyst for the open source community as well. It turns out that the most exciting development in recent years is not just the existence of the GPTs and chat GPT, but the fact that many universities, research groups and companies have open sourced their code for training and running these models. And when the nerds start building stuff together in the open, working on public data, working in public building in public, for free and without restrictions, interesting things,\\n[02:30.000 --> 02:38.400]  start to happen. And one of them is called llama.cpp. That's l l a m a.cpp. I guess it is a cross platform\\n[02:38.400 --> 02:43.440]  framework that I found that is completely open source that allows us to train and run our own AI\\n[02:43.440 --> 02:50.160]  models on our consumer hardware that we own our computers, our laptops, our desktop systems, our\\n[02:50.160 --> 02:55.840]  servers if you want to. And we don't need to have the massive GPUs and RAM amounts that the big guys\\n[02:55.840 --> 03:01.840]  have. But we still get to run tech that's almost as good. Obviously, if you have GPUs that have\\n[03:01.840 --> 03:07.600]  hundreds of gigabytes of RAM, you can run larger models, which is what GPT is, right? These things\\n[03:07.600 --> 03:13.840]  have tens, if not hundreds of billions of parameters that trained on the models that run on consumer\\n[03:13.840 --> 03:19.840]  hardware, they have seven or maybe 13 billions of parameters, which is still a lot of parameters.\\n[03:20.400 --> 03:26.160]  It is just a slight difference there. But again, almost as good. And in most cases,\\n[03:26.160 --> 03:30.000]  for entrepreneurs, particularly when you're starting out building prototypes and stuff,\\n[03:30.000 --> 03:35.680]  it's good enough. The big contributor here is that we can avoid those costs and dependencies\\n[03:35.680 --> 03:40.960]  associated with using hosted platforms like opening ice API. And in addition to that,\\n[03:40.960 --> 03:46.960]  or maybe because of it, we gain more control and flexibility over AI applications for our own\\n[03:46.960 --> 03:53.120]  businesses. So the risk goes down and control goes up. And that kind of is the indie founders\\n[03:53.120 --> 03:57.680]  dream, right? You de-risk and you get more control. I think that's just wonderful. Let me share an\\n[03:57.680 --> 04:03.280]  example from just this week that I have found worked to work really well with my own business.\\n[04:03.280 --> 04:10.000]  POTSGAT was, until Wednesday, a keyword alerting tool for podcasts. You would write down or configure\\n[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  a list of words in my user interface. And POTS then would transcribe every newly released\\n[04:16.000 --> 04:20.320]  podcast out there as quickly as it could, then compare your list against the transcript and alert\\n[04:20.320 --> 04:24.800]  you if there was a match, right? Just regular kind of keyword matching. The magic in this product\\n[04:24.800 --> 04:30.640]  really is that it ingests all podcasts everywhere. But it was a fairly simple kind of checking for\\n[04:30.640 --> 04:35.680]  keywords so far so good. And this is already creating massive value in the world of podcast\\n[04:35.680 --> 04:40.880]  discovery, which is severely underserved. And it's kind of hard because audio is hard to introspect.\\n[04:40.880 --> 04:46.480]  But now consider this from a user perspective. What if you don't know the keywords beforehand?\\n[04:46.480 --> 04:51.120]  What if you want to be alerted for something that is more nebulous? Something like all podcasts\\n[04:51.120 --> 04:56.320]  where people talk about community events that are organized by women or all podcasts where people\\n[04:56.320 --> 05:01.840]  really nerd out about their favorite TV show? You can't just look for TV show as a keyword.\\n[05:01.840 --> 05:06.000]  That's just going to give you everybody talking about every TV show in any capacity.\\n[05:06.960 --> 05:10.560]  And even if you wanted to, you couldn't come up with all the specific keywords that would\\n[05:10.560 --> 05:14.960]  allow you to reliably match every podcast that falls into these categories either.\\n[05:14.960 --> 05:20.560]  But what if you could ask a simple question to each show? Questions like, does this episode\\n[05:20.560 --> 05:26.400]  have nerds talk about sci-fi in an excited way? And that's what local AI allowed me to build in\\n[05:26.400 --> 05:33.840]  like a day and a half, which is crazy. With the help of llama.cpp and a large language model called\\n[05:33.840 --> 05:39.200]  Mistral 7BE, the 7BE should not be surprising. I just mentioned that some of these models have\\n[05:39.200 --> 05:45.520]  7 billion parameters. I set up a backend service that takes a transcript that the other AI in my\\n[05:45.520 --> 05:53.680]  system trades. It takes a question and then it spits out either a yes or a no. And that means that\\n[05:53.680 --> 05:58.960]  if the question is answered with a yes, is this the show hosted by nerds talking about sci-fi,\\n[05:58.960 --> 06:06.080]  then you get an alert, but only then. And this system takes any transcript and any question\\n[06:06.080 --> 06:12.880]  and answers the question on the transcript in under a second per combination. And most importantly,\\n[06:12.880 --> 06:17.440]  it does this on the same hardware that my transcription servers are already running on.\\n[06:17.440 --> 06:21.680]  And they're just like gobbling up all these new podcast episodes and transcribing them\\n[06:21.680 --> 06:27.200]  in between transcriptions. I sometimes just do some inference. So I'd ask this question of the\\n[06:27.200 --> 06:33.040]  transcript. I don't have to count API calls. I just have to have a computer with a GPU with like\\n[06:33.120 --> 06:38.560]  8 gigabyte of RAM and a little bit more maybe. But that is enough. And cloud hosting for GPUs\\n[06:38.560 --> 06:44.000]  right now is still super expensive. You pay around $500 per month for a single server with a GPU.\\n[06:44.720 --> 06:49.840]  But even a Mac mini, which is like 800 bucks can run this kind of AI inference at one question\\n[06:50.560 --> 06:56.480]  to a transcript per second. And it's quite literally both what I'm recording this on right now and\\n[06:56.480 --> 07:01.360]  where it's running in the background still. Like I'm recording a podcast episode on the computer that\\n[07:01.360 --> 07:07.920]  is just inferring and transcribing as I speak. That's the power of GPU based stuff. The GPU\\n[07:07.920 --> 07:13.600]  is not needed for audio recording. So it can just keep pulling data and deal with audio while I speak.\\n[07:13.600 --> 07:19.680]  It's incredible. And platforms like OpenAI and other competitors have started to compete there\\n[07:19.680 --> 07:25.680]  on price. They understand that people have started to run this locally too. OpenAI's API is a big\\n[07:25.680 --> 07:31.280]  mover here towards the lower prices. It's really, really affordable to use GPD 3.5.\\n[07:31.280 --> 07:37.840]  That's kind of the budget version of GPD because the current GPD, the most recent version is GPD 4\\n[07:37.840 --> 07:41.840]  and it's super powerful, has a much more recent knowledge cut off and it's more\\n[07:41.840 --> 07:46.320]  performance in certain things. And GPD 3.5 is kind of what we had when we started out.\\n[07:46.320 --> 07:51.920]  Ish, right? It's good for any task that you need to scale on. And you can get millions of tokens\\n[07:52.000 --> 07:56.560]  and those are words or characters for under a dollar. That's quite impressive. And let's be\\n[07:56.560 --> 08:01.680]  reasonable. I guess it fits most budgets if you just have to work through some text data some of the\\n[08:01.680 --> 08:06.800]  time. But it doesn't fit all budgets. If you deal with lots of data and you need to run prompts on\\n[08:06.800 --> 08:12.720]  the data constantly, like if you were analyzing every English speaking podcast out there at all times,\\n[08:12.720 --> 08:18.640]  GPD 3.5 can cost tens with hundreds of dollars per day. GPD 4 would easily go into the thousands\\n[08:18.640 --> 08:22.640]  if you were running it constantly. That's not scalable for a small business.\\n[08:22.640 --> 08:30.080]  But running your own local LLM, that sure is. Having AI on a server was impossible for a long time.\\n[08:30.080 --> 08:35.200]  And the requirement of current GPU still makes it somewhat expensive. But fortunately,\\n[08:35.200 --> 08:40.960]  AI comes in two forms, inference and training, right? Like the inference is kind of the applying a\\n[08:40.960 --> 08:45.840]  prompt and getting a reply and training is setting up the model. And inference itself is\\n[08:45.840 --> 08:51.760]  surprisingly possible on regular old CPUs as well. Traditionally, over the last few years,\\n[08:51.760 --> 08:56.240]  all kinds of machine learning and AI work has been done on the GPU because GPUs are designed for a\\n[08:56.240 --> 09:00.640]  massive parallel computation. They're graphics processing. They are supposed to create these\\n[09:00.640 --> 09:05.680]  really immersive game worlds. And recent CPUs have added tensor cores, which handle specific\\n[09:05.680 --> 09:10.000]  mathematical operations that are also used in games and machine learning and all kinds of\\n[09:10.080 --> 09:16.320]  other computation heavy things. So your computers boring old CPU handles regular\\n[09:16.320 --> 09:21.760]  more straightforward linear computations and the GPU is much faster for certain parallel tasks.\\n[09:21.760 --> 09:29.440]  But in recent times, LLMs that used to require a GPU now run hilariously fast on a CPU as well,\\n[09:29.440 --> 09:35.120]  mostly also because those CPUs have lots of cores. I recently rented the cloud server somewhere for,\\n[09:35.120 --> 09:40.400]  I think it has a GPU attached. So that's the reason why I rented, but it has 32 CPU cores\\n[09:40.400 --> 09:47.440]  that I can use for CPU computation as well. It's crazy. The amount of cores that you can do parallel\\n[09:47.440 --> 09:55.200]  processing on just shot up magnificently so you can now do inference on those systems as well.\\n[09:55.200 --> 10:00.880]  You can run models, 7B, 13B models, even on your computer without a graphics card. And that's what\\n[10:00.880 --> 10:06.160]  most servers are. They are computed without GPUs, but with quite some RAM and a lot of CPU\\n[10:06.160 --> 10:10.800]  occurs in that as well. And this changes that to the growth of an open source community creating\\n[10:10.800 --> 10:16.960]  local launch language model tools that can be used on both kind of chips. And that's the dot CPP\\n[10:16.960 --> 10:24.240]  and llama dot CPP. It's C++. It signifies that these tools were meant for CPU based inference.\\n[10:24.240 --> 10:30.320]  And whisper CPP, the speech to text sibling project also is meant to run on the CPU. And the open\\n[10:30.320 --> 10:34.320]  source nature of these projects has been supported by an unlikely ally.\\n[10:35.040 --> 10:39.200]  Meta, the company behind Facebook, the company we all love for their privacy intrusion, that\\n[10:39.200 --> 10:45.280]  kind of stuff, they release an open source large language model called llama in 2023. And that's\\n[10:45.280 --> 10:49.680]  pretty big for them to go into open source that much. I mean, they've done this with React and\\n[10:49.680 --> 10:55.680]  other projects, but you know, it is pretty significant that the competitor, the open AI's competitor,\\n[10:55.680 --> 11:00.480]  that that would be meta releases their models and the training data and all that for free.\\n[11:01.360 --> 11:06.160]  Because open AI's GPT models, they're proprietary. The company has published only research papers,\\n[11:06.160 --> 11:11.920]  no code. That inspired people to build their own models using public data. There's even a benchmarking\\n[11:11.920 --> 11:16.640]  system to compare these self trained models like Mistral 7B and all these many, many others\\n[11:16.640 --> 11:22.080]  with the proprietary models like GPT 3 or GPT 4. And some of these new models come pretty close.\\n[11:22.720 --> 11:28.560]  Now, independent companies and open source communities released new large language models daily now\\n[11:28.560 --> 11:33.440]  that perform better than GPT 3.5. Maybe not as scalable. They don't have the infrastructure\\n[11:33.440 --> 11:39.440]  that open AI has, but they are the whole like server cluster. But the model itself performs better\\n[11:39.440 --> 11:45.360]  more accurately and more reliably, sometimes faster. And these things almost perform as well as\\n[11:45.360 --> 11:49.680]  GPT 4, which is kind of the gold standard of these models right now in terms of speed and accuracy.\\n[11:50.240 --> 11:55.440]  These open source models are available to everyone. That includes me and that includes you. And they\\n[11:55.440 --> 12:00.400]  help advance the field of the AI language processing quite significantly because the moment we start\\n[12:00.400 --> 12:05.840]  using these things, we find the flaws, we report this on GitHub and all these pages that exist where\\n[12:05.840 --> 12:10.560]  these models are hosted. And you will find those models on huggingface.co, which is an interesting\\n[12:10.560 --> 12:14.240]  name for an interesting company. But it's a website where you can download these open source\\n[12:14.240 --> 12:18.960]  language models in various forms. Whatever form you need, whatever tool you use, you will find\\n[12:18.960 --> 12:23.440]  the model of your choice in that format there. I recommend following a person called\\n[12:23.440 --> 12:29.120]  Tom Jobins there. I think their nickname is the bloke. Tom's models come in all kinds of formats\\n[12:29.120 --> 12:32.640]  and they've been reliably good to me. I've been using models from that person's\\n[12:33.920 --> 12:39.920]  page there quite a lot. People like Tom, they don't just upload the model. They share the source\\n[12:39.920 --> 12:44.560]  material, the training data, and all the files needed to run it on your own computer,\\n[12:44.560 --> 12:51.520]  which is really cool. That's really all that is to that. You download llama.cpp from GitHub,\\n[12:51.520 --> 12:57.200]  you compile it, and it's a cross-platform thing. So it works on Windows and Linux and Mac. It doesn't\\n[12:57.200 --> 13:02.320]  really matter. You download a model, which is just one download from huggingface.co. I don't\\n[13:02.320 --> 13:07.200]  think you even need to be logged in there to download it. And then you're done. Llama lets you run a\\n[13:07.200 --> 13:12.000]  command on your computer or start a little server that loads a large language model into your graphics\\n[13:12.080 --> 13:16.240]  card memory or your regular memory. And then it allows you to do local inference through an\\n[13:16.240 --> 13:22.560]  API. Like HTTP, you send an HTTP request or you just put the link to the file or the link to adjacent\\n[13:22.560 --> 13:26.720]  file where you have some data in there. It's crazy. It even comes with an example page. It's very\\n[13:26.720 --> 13:32.880]  simple to use. And even if you're not into AI and don't see an immediate use for it, I highly\\n[13:32.880 --> 13:38.000]  recommend looking into this. Llama automatically detects the best capacity your computer has\\n[13:38.000 --> 13:41.840]  for running inference. It checks if there's a GPU available, if you have the right drivers,\\n[13:41.840 --> 13:46.640]  and if you have the toolkits installed that you need, and then it uses these to maximize efficiency.\\n[13:46.640 --> 13:51.280]  And the community on the GitHub page is really, really good too. So you will find a lot of help\\n[13:51.280 --> 13:56.560]  if you want to set this up. You'll have a fast and as fast and performant, I guess, an API\\n[13:57.120 --> 14:02.560]  on your own personal computer as you would if you were to use an API. And that's quite magical.\\n[14:02.640 --> 14:08.080]  And it's yours. That's the thing, right? I think this is the year where software entrepreneurs learn\\n[14:08.080 --> 14:13.840]  how to wrangle control back onto their systems. And AI is one of the fields where this happens.\\n[14:13.840 --> 14:19.040]  It's going to be a wild ride for sure and things change every day. But there's something incredibly\\n[14:19.040 --> 14:26.080]  powerful about knowing that OpenAI can implode tomorrow and shut down the API. But my local\\n[14:26.080 --> 14:31.600]  installation of Mist 4.7b and a couple of cloud computers that have it running to will still be\\n[14:31.600 --> 14:36.560]  mine to command. They don't belong to anybody but me. I mean, it's the cloud. Somebody else's\\n[14:36.560 --> 14:40.240]  computer. But you know what I mean, right? The installation, the software itself, something that\\n[14:40.240 --> 14:47.040]  I could just clone as an image and run somewhere else that is mine. Local AI is powerful and it's\\n[14:47.040 --> 14:52.960]  here to stay. And that's it for today. I want to briefly thank my sponsor, acquire.com. Because\\n[14:52.960 --> 14:57.200]  one thing that stood out to me this week as well in reflecting on this is how much more\\n[14:57.280 --> 15:03.680]  sellable having ownership over your backend magic like AI can make your business. And acquirer\\n[15:03.680 --> 15:07.600]  always buying through liabilities as well, right? That's what they buy. They buy the good and the\\n[15:07.600 --> 15:14.000]  bad. They buy the whole business. But if you have these powerful AI systems in-house on your servers,\\n[15:14.000 --> 15:19.920]  their liability is kind of reduced to keeping the servers running. And frankly, that is what they're\\n[15:19.920 --> 15:25.040]  used to. Anyway, that's how acquirers work. They know that software businesses need service to\\n[15:25.040 --> 15:32.720]  keep running, right? So for them, the AI on the backend is a bonus. And local AI, therefore,\\n[15:32.720 --> 15:37.440]  is kind of an acquisition price boost for when you eventually sell your software business.\\n[15:37.440 --> 15:41.760]  And I guess there are many reasons to sell your business. Maybe you are done. Maybe you're done\\n[15:41.760 --> 15:45.680]  with the work you build, what you wanted to build, you want to do something else. You reached a skill\\n[15:45.680 --> 15:51.280]  ceiling, you want a different lifestyle, whatever it is, no matter why you might want a change\\n[15:51.360 --> 15:56.080]  in your life, selling your business. At that point, it's probably a very impactful and positive\\n[15:56.080 --> 16:01.520]  experience, especially if you sell your SaaS on acquirer.com. The folks over there, they've helped\\n[16:01.520 --> 16:06.400]  thousands of people sell their valuable businesses for life changing amounts of money. And the things\\n[16:06.400 --> 16:12.000]  you don't have to sell today. But if you're ever interested in pivoting into financial security,\\n[16:12.000 --> 16:18.160]  you probably want to check out acquirer.com. Go to try the acquirer.com slash arid and see if\\n[16:18.160 --> 16:21.680]  this is for you and your business right now. It's always good to plan ahead.\\n[16:22.400 --> 16:25.920]  Thank you for listening to the Boots of Founder today. You can find me on Twitter at\\n[16:25.920 --> 16:32.800]  Aviadkah.com.

I've been promoting this product on Twitter just through building it in public and initiating potential partnerships through back channels. That's also something I've been doing. Specifically, I'm reaching out to a podcast hosting and aggregating and community building platforms to integrate Podline FM at some point. This outreach is part of a very slow and strategic approach\\n[00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.519] to building partnerships in the space.\\n[00:01:45.519 --> 00:03:00.000] I want Podline to be able to integrate into automatically generated landing pages, which is why I'm talking to all these podcast hosting companies and stuff, right? That makes sense. It's becoming more and more adapted handling the diversity of browsers and\\n[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.400] technologies that users employ, right? Just to access the product or access the internet.\\n[00:03:04.400 --> 00:04:21.240] Like there are five, six browsers competitors in the space, right? You get a voice message, you reply to the voice message, they get notification, and then they reply and back and forth like\\n[00:04:21.240 --> 00:05:42.040] a conversation, but with traceable and individually downloadable voice messages. But after receiving like a notification that prompts an action, which is clicking a link in this notification in the email to receive a variable reward, which is the unknown contents of the message, the thing you want to know about. That's why you click the link. And that then leads to an investment in the platform as you reply to that message, which triggers the whole cycle again with a notification for another person who then clicks the link,\\n[00:05:42.040 --> 00:07:03.720] checks it out, applies, you get a notification, you in the end, but you don't want the browser that is randomly installed on your listener's computer to take care of this. You want to do it yourself. Maybe not. I don't know. That's why I need to talk to people. I'm considering whether to process audio in the backend for quality enhancement that I think is good or that a pro audio technician would think is good or leave it to the discretion\\n[00:07:03.720 --> 00:08:21.439] of my customers. It's kind of a. These resources will be created using Statamic, yet another powerful tool in the Laravel ecosystem, easily integrated into the existing codebase for which I'm very excited. And finally, this week also despite previously focusing on server-side AI, as I talked about it on this podcast last week,\\n[00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:25.839] I'm now considering experimenting with GPT 3.5 or GPT 4,\\n[00:08:25.839 --> 00:09:42.139] being integrated through API calls from OpenAI, using that platform. and the challenges of creating a new product. No code has always been a contender for me for these initial prototypes, and I've recommended it to a lot of people in the past. And when I started building Podline, I obviously explored No Code tools to see if they could help me create what I wanted. My project needed a highly customizable audio input widget to embed on other websites, and then unique ways to transcribe and summarize\\n[00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:44.799] that audio data into these insights for my customers\\n[00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.799] that I really wanted the outcome of using the product to be.\\n[00:09:47.799 --> 00:11:02.080] And I had to figure control over this. I don't want to depend on that platform because ultimately, Podline is a self-contained system in my mind, with all\\n[00:11:02.080 --> 00:12:21.000] necessary components run internally without extra cost other than running the server, I guess, And many no-code solutions are to build tools for early adopters and innovators. I know you can also build tools obviously for the mass market using these technologies, but most use cases are for prototyping really. And these things can cross the chasm, but I don't see my initial experiments being valuable when built on somebody else's platform\\n[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000] with those kind of limitations.\\n[00:12:23.000 --> 00:13:41.799] I'm sure that I would have much more troublebering together some APIs because there is initial complexity to this product, right? It's about treating audio data with respect and fitting whatever the platform ends up doing into an existing workflow done by a professional who has a monetary, a budgetary responsibility in their work.\\n[00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:45.120] This is not just a tool that people may or may not use.\\n[00:13:45.120 --> 00:15:01.919] Once this is part of their tool chain, it Laravel framework with this easy to integrate services. And Laravel has many plugins and extensions, very similar to no code tools if you think about it. I wonder how these things were inspiring each other over the last couple of years. I installed Laravel initially, I installed Jetstream and Spark, these two plugins,\\n[00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:05.360] and with a few clicks or I guess terminal commands in my case,\\n[00:15:06.320 --> 00:16:23.039] after just a few kicks of that, until last week or so Google Co-pilot integrated and since last week also has JetBrains own AI assistant which is trained on several of these co-pilot like AI systems. It's really cool. This assistant has saved me so much time by sometimes even suggesting solutions before I knew there was a problem. It's bizarre. AI-assisted coding is like no-code really because the machine\\n[00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:27.440] does the coding part. The developer's job is just to judge the quality and the\\n[00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:29.839] from your own code. It's really, really powerful. And developers today just don't need to go through the same challenges as I did like 10 or 20 years ago. They have now these wonderful tools at their\\n[00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:34.640] disposal, making them more like low coders in some way, right? And this is not meant as an insult.\\n[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.839] It just shows that understanding every intricacy of code and the systems that you're operating on,\\n[00:17:39.839 --> 00:20:22.559] that's really no's it for today. where to go. You don't know what it is. Do you like skills? Do you just like the time? Do you like the willingness to keep going? Do you have something else you want to do? All of these are good reasons. But most of the time people just keep wondering and don't do anything about it. And then over time, the business slowly loses value until at its worst, it's completely worthless because they just\\n[00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:28.160] stop caring and they stop putting effort into it. Before this happens, you have a choice. And the\",\"episode_description\":\"<p>I've always been a fan of no-code tools. But recently, I stumbled into AI-assisted coding.

We delve into Kei's transformative journey of\\n[00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:18.160] self-discovery and self-acceptance and how he found joy and satisfaction in no longer chasing\\n[00:00:18.160 --> 00:01:40.519] promotions. Kei shares his profound thoughts on what it truly means to have enough and how this You're taking me back first. Thank you for having me on. And after so many years of Twitter friendship, the breaking bread together is amazing. Yeah, so I'll take you back to that moment. This presentation, I was 30, 31 years old on Wall Street. And I'm like, I kick butt at this job.\\n[00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:42.840] I work, I work anyone.\\n[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.760] I play the long game.\\n[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760] I've always kind of prided myself\\n[00:01:46.760 --> 00:03:01.960] on like understanding the meta games of things. way infinitely more successful than me financially, everything, by every metric. And they're talking about their number, once I hit X, eight figures, 50 million, whatever the number was. And then they asked me, because I'm not as motivated to grow, and they said, well, are you trying to get to this\\n[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.080] so that you can do more, get to this number\\n[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.919] so you can do more of this?\\n[00:03:04.919 --> 00:04:22.600] I'm like, no, I'm perfectly fine here, making maybe less, but feeling that less is not too little. I find that very interesting and highly relatable. I'm in the same spot, which is why you saying,\\n[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.759] I don't know, resonated with me so much in that moment.\\n[00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.879] And I would like to explore this a little bit more\\n[00:04:27.879 --> 00:05:42.000] because I feel a lot of the research, like, you know, that's 75,000, like 75,000. My rent's more than 75,000 a year. So that equation, maybe I'm not the one at fault here, but that's, you know, I'm not here to say that there's a number for that curve. But then you take someone like Elon or Bezos, right?\\n[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.959] I think Bezos at $150 billion.\\n[00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:45.800] If you are-\\n[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.639] What does that mean?\\n[00:05:46.639 --> 00:07:02.720] What does this mean, right? middle class, children of immigrants, you know, hustled, nothing was handed to them. Right? And so there's this fear that you're going to go back. Right? So that's part of the scarcity going back. Right? And I shared this tweet the other day and Scott Galloway and Sam Parr and they respectively have $100 million and $20 million.\\n[00:07:02.720 --> 00:08:25.139] And they're both, you could tell their, their, money can buy you back more time, but it can't buy you into shape. Right? You know, money can buy you marriage therapy, but it can't necessarily save you from having married the wrong person. Money can buy you great healthcare. I saw Brian\\n[00:08:25.139 --> 00:09:41.480] Johnson, you know, the longevity be 44, live at home with two kids and your wife, but you could. If I needed to live at my parents' house in New York City, I could. Yeah. It'd be really embarrassing. That's the rat race kind of argument, right?\\n[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.320] Like the-\\n[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.659] Exactly.\\n[00:09:43.659 --> 00:09:46.080] Yeah, you can really easily step out of it, I think,\\n[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.480] but if everybody around you is on the same track,\\n[00:09:48.480 --> 00:11:02.840] that's the few things.\\n[00:11:02.840 --> 00:12:20.600] One thing is that you can intellectual it up from first principles. And so I think in one of my recent videos, I was like, I have a success statement. What does success mean to me? And so my success statement is I want to express myself creatively every day. And that includes what I wear. It's very important for me to be able to wear what I want to wear.\\n[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.440] I like fashion.\\n[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.460] I like feeling good about how I look.\\n[00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:28.139] I want to own my time, like be flexible.\\n[00:12:28.139 --> 00:13:41.019] But here's the ironic thing. you start to see if, you know, I'm a productivity person, the best way to be productive is to align your activities with what you value. That is the meta game of productivity. And you could see that, what do I value? How do I do these activities, right? Like, that's all that. So that's like the meta game of productivity.\\n[00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:44.220] So go back to the success statement is be creative every day,\\n[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.379] including how I dress, that's important.\\n[00:13:46.379 --> 00:15:00.000] Cause it makes me happy to dress moment. I really love this. And as you explained this as kind of a development over time,\\n[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000] what came to mind immediately is this is very close to my success statement\\n[00:15:05.000 --> 00:16:23.179] right now, but 10 years ago, young adulthood, living in New York. My financial needs were starting to get met. The gold posts were moving to some extent. But that was really about status.\\n[00:16:23.179 --> 00:17:41.000] And I wanted to be known as someone who was and immediate like, I'm like, no one loves me. It doesn't matter what's written on a piece of paper. All it matters is in that moment, I feel like no one loves me. Wow, thank you for sharing this.\\n[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000] That's a deep hurt, I would assume,\\n[00:17:46.160 --> 00:19:02.200] that you have to deal with a lot. these things so strongly that it starts gnawing at our soul. And with all the rationalization we could have, right? With these people don't know me, parasocial relationships, what do I care? It still hurts and it doesn't stop, right? That's how I feel. Is that something you can relate to? Oh my God, you're giving me goosebumps just thinking about that. And I think this is something that I didn't realize\\n[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.559] until the past couple of years is that,\\n[00:19:06.539 --> 00:20:21.279] whatever you think intellectually, of unworthiness. And again, I think if you unpack it, maybe it's because my dad is a survivor of the Cambodian genocide. So it could be these imprints of intergenerational trauma, which is not an area that I know much about, but I'm starting to learn bits and pieces about it.\\n[00:20:21.279 --> 00:21:41.559] Another might be that as a child of immigrant parenting The number of people that say to their kids, stop crying, myself included. So I'm not trying to shame anyone. But I was like, oh my God. The number of times that my parents said, stop X, stop Y, stop feeling X, stop feeling Y, which is probably because they coming to the United States, leaving war torn countries, they literally had to stop feeling\\n[00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:43.599] because stopping feeling was a matter of life\\n[00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:45.019] and death for them.\\n[00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:47.640] And for my generation, second generation,\\n[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:53.160] me and I remember when I was a teenager I asked someone who was maybe like five years older than me and like uh if a single guy can't find a wife can they adopt a kid and\\n[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.920] they're like no the person was older like no single men can adopt kids like that's just\\n[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.000] you know they're just like that's against cultural programming and I think it's actually\\n[00:23:01.000 --> 00:24:21.000] pretty hard for a single even today it would be hard for a single man to adopt a kid but which is where I am now, is well, what is purpose and meaning? Because all the other boxes, again, because of the investments, my parents, the sacrifices my parents made for me because of the hard work and the luck that I had over my career, I've kind of moved up the rungs and like, oh, this is the big kahuna, right?\\n[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000] Purpose and meaning, right?\\n[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000] And, you know, a lot of listeners would be like, well, you know, if you have money,\\n[00:24:26.000 --> 00:25:40.039] you can solve for that. You saw my TikToks, you're like, he's definitely not Gen Z. So maybe I just behave like a millennial. Full stop. I'm right on the border of X and millennial. And so just to give you some perspective, when I entered the workforce in 2001, I got a job at Wall Street.\\n[00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:42.359] It was so common.\\n[00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:44.599] They're like, congrats, you got a job.\\n[00:25:44.599 --> 00:27:02.240] Let's get you blackout drunk and then take you to it, sleep. And again, this is a biased industry view. It's a very intense, very macho misogynist industry. But I think it was the cultural narrative. I mean, like when, you know, one generation before, people were getting drunk at lunch, right? So it's funny how the times change.\\n[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.799] It's only like 40 years ago that people were getting\\n[00:27:04.799 --> 00:28:22.000] shit-faced at lunch was still drinking, right? Hopefully. Were you still drinking? Yeah, sure. Still like, still drinking. And so yeah, mental health is.\\n[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.960] And then you take that with kind of Asian, first generation,\\n[00:28:25.960 --> 00:29:41.359] child of first generation culture. communities of people, communities of the same experience where people share with each other. That I think is a big deal, that observation, that it is through the internet, through the connectivity, that we first get to learn from other people that have the exact same problem, and that it is a problem in the first place. Absolutely. And a little bit of a tangent,\\n[00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:46.079] but I think it will be relevant here is that when I left Wall Street, I started a newsletter.\\n[00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:47.920] and someone who's 10 years younger than me that's kind of seeing the younger version of me,\\n[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.920] they're like, I'm that person right now.\\n[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.680] And they live in Sydney, Australia, right?\\n[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.519] They've never been to the United States before.\\n[00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:59.539] Which is why it's so wonderful\\n[00:30:59.539 --> 00:31:02.480] that you are sharing all of this in public with people.\\n[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.000] I mean, you could have just kept it to yourself\\n[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.160] and do whatever,\\n[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.079] because that is also a legitimate option\\n[00:31:07.079 --> 00:32:21.000] if you have all the options, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, I still have it when I get Len in LaGuardia. But thank you for saying that. And I do, it's weird. Because today my wife never listens. I just listen to my content because it's too much of it and she's so bored of it.\\n[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.160] But I put a podcast episode out and I've\\n[00:32:25.160 --> 00:36:21.960] been more transparent about talking about money. that it's just, look, I don't want to be like an all saintly of it, but I just like, I feel like you make a commitment to me to sit through my podcast and read my writing and follow my tweets. I need to make a commitment to you that I'm being honest. Right. And it doesn't without like spinning anything around it, I can just do it in two minutes. Otherwise, it would take me 10. It's a. Yeah, good luck with that one, right? So there's so many things in life where if you just release into it,\\n[00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:26.440] it just, it finds you. And I tell my team, I have one colleague now,\\n[00:36:26.440 --> 00:37:41.119] and I'm like, look don't, I'm a long form writer. I don't think in terms of hooks.\\n[00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.119] Like that's not on my brainwaves.\\n[00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:43.119] That's performative, right?\\n[00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:44.119] Yeah.\\n[00:37:44.119 --> 00:39:00.300] And it, look, I'm not, it's, I I always encourage people to ask themselves is, am I playing the right game? Yeah. Right? It's like, what game are you playing? Right?\\n[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.139] Yeah.\\n[00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:02.940] Well, you strike me as a person that plays\\n[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.360] an infinite game at all times.\\n[00:39:05.360 --> 00:40:26.480] You know, I never know how many players are playing, you don't even know what they're truly playing. But everybody is playing, everybody is doing something beneficial. That's my definition and I am very strongly on this side of the infinite game and I see you do the exact same. Can I confess that I do see, I do see, play a lot of infinite games but I do fall sucker\\n[00:40:26.480 --> 00:41:41.340] to finite games as well. screen, should I tweet this? I'm like, then I'm like the guy, but I really, and I still might tweet it. So if you're listening to this and I tweet it, please call me out in my mentions, because I will be a little bit of a hip, but I'll say like, I'm, I'm still motivated by ego, just, I think a lot less than a lot of other people.\\n[00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:44.760] Um, and I can have the conversation in my head.\\n[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.920] I'm like, do you really want to be that guy?\\n[00:41:46.960 --> 00:43:00.800] Cause you make fun of that guy, but it was also a better decision because I had actually been seduced into a game that I didn't want to play. And that game, what I think I realized about Infoproducts is it's really a digital marketing game. And I'm not that good at it.\\n[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.199] I'm okay at it, but I'm not good at it.\\n[00:43:04.199 --> 00:44:21.820] But I don't want to play that game at all. When I left Wall Street, I was tempted to become a venture back founder because that was the high status thing in 2015. Like this was way before the creator and people were writing newsletters on tiny letter. That's the, that's the time of the internet that like Snapchat had just gotten it. Instagram had just ripped off stories from Snapchat in 2015.\\n[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:25.079] That's how long ago that was or short, however you see it.\\n[00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:26.579] So I made a decision.\\n[00:44:26.579 --> 00:45:41.400] I was like, I want to be a venture Wall Street, it's a pretty stable trajectory once you hit a certain level. And so I had a sense that every year that I left, I probably would have made somewhere between one and $2 million of W-2. And so I've been gone for 10 years.\\n[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.679] And so without growth, without taxes,\\n[00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:46.960] that's 10 million bucks.\\n[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.239] products had created a prison of my own making marketing and marketing prison.\\n[00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:48.719] I was like, one pillar was like conversion based marketing. Like the next pillar was copywriting.\\n[00:46:48.719 --> 00:46:51.039] And then the next pillar was landing page optimization.\\n[00:46:51.039 --> 00:46:52.159] Next pillar was SEO.\\n[00:46:52.639 --> 00:46:56.320] You know, I was a prisoner to digital marketing and I created it for myself.\\n[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.840] Sometime over the summer, and this is where these things where it's\\n[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.599] like emotional and not intellectual.\\n[00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:05.119] I was just like, I don't care about this anymore.\\n[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.400] And the funny thing is I couldn't tell anyone that either.\\n[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.519] I'm free and I could make all these different decisions\\n[00:48:08.199 --> 00:48:09.039] and I'm still fine.\\n[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.440] And that thing was so, there's never been teal on a rainbow.\\n[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.920] Oh, that's funny. Do you think you still need stories\\n[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.719] or have you given up stories completely at this point?\\n[00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:20.559] No, I still need them.\\n[00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.440] Dude, I'm fucking human, man.\\n[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.440] Dude, every night, so my thing is I get envious of people.\\n[00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:25.840] Yeah, but you know what? They will probably have so much more money than you will ever dream about.\\n[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.639] Right.\\n[00:49:26.639 --> 00:49:30.480] And I feel I have a moment when I feel shitty.\\n[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.320] And so I take I started this new practice.\\n[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.760] I just I just made it up.\\n[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.119] I started this new practice where whenever I it's I call it my envy log.\\n[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.239] And so whenever I feel envy, I just take a little mental note of it.\\n[00:49:46.239 --> 00:51:00.059] And it's usually with another bed, and then I just, if you're not watching this, my eyes are closed, I'm like a mummy laying down. And I'm just like, okay, you're envious about Morgan, and you just like take a few breaths,\\n[00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:02.000] just feel what you need to feel about,\\n[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.840] it's kind of like the way you would talk to a child,\\n[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.000] just feel what you need to feel about Morgan,\\n[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.119] just let it sit with it,\\n[00:51:07.119 --> 00:52:21.159] there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling. I'm deeply influenced by Eastern philosophy and Buddhism. And so I'm sure that that's some extrapolation of interpretation of one of those. So anyway. It sounds very much like- So I do tell the stories all the time. And that's, I think the human condition is that we live in narrative. I think that's just either narrative we create in ourselves\\n[00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:22.760] or narrative that comes from the outside.\\n[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.000] We talked extensively about expectations of others\\n[00:52:26.000 --> 00:53:41.900] in this conversation. in sharing these things so, I'm getting emotional. So honestly and so clearly, because we all try to get to this point and often stop ourselves, right? We have these limiting beliefs that we can't, that we shouldn't, that we're not supposed to, and you're doing it in such a strong way. I'm just really grateful that you're doing this.\\n[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.420] And I'm grateful that you spent an hour of your time\\n[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.300] almost with me here today.\\n[00:53:46.300 --> 00:55:01.760] I am a big fan if you just Google Twitter, Keihe, or look in the show notes.

This episode is sponsored by Acquirer.com which is great because that's\\n[00:00:23.839 --> 00:01:42.560] precisely where I want to see this software as a from them, and I got to share all of that with the world at the same time. I could not imagine a more rewarding experience. But recently I felt this itch to code again. And I mean, I've always felt it a little, but I never had a reason to dive back into it.\\n[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.760] But the more I saw the developments in the software space,\\n[00:01:45.760 --> 00:03:01.819] the more I got excited. to use in their books so that the links always work, either linking to the intended site or to an archived version. That's a problem that I personally had with my first book. And I found a lot of other writers struggling with it as well. So I built a little business there, which is nice. It's so running and it has a couple of customers, nothing too big, but it does work. And I believe finding problems you understand\\n[00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.539] is the right way because you've faced similar challenges\\n[00:03:06.539 --> 00:04:20.720] in the past and that's a of what I needed, right? A tool that made that happen because I toyed with asking for listener questions before, but the tools were horrible and I couldn't manage the many submissions that I did get\\n[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720] when I did ask.\\n[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.139] So now that my podcast audience is in the five figures, regular tools won't cut it anymore\\n[00:04:27.139 --> 00:05:41.899] and this is where there's already demands. This is what Justin Jackson of Transistor FM, also a great podcasting tool, always says, right?\\n[00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.579] Find the poll of the market,\\n[00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:45.079] and this is the poll of the market.\\n[00:05:45.079 --> 00:07:02.279] People who already have a stake in their existing podcast for the companies using the current solutions out there, that's what I have now. That's a full Excel export that I have like thousands, like in the middle range of thousands, half, like 5,000 or three or four, depends on how you structure the report. That is the number of websites that I know use and pay for a tool like this. That's a very useful and highly motivating source\\n[00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.319] of information because money flows already.\\n[00:07:05.319 --> 00:08:20.680] And I know where it flows from and where it flows to. out loud sitting at my computer, or just how efficient the AI integrations that I was using were. Like Google Copilot integration in my editor is just like chef's kiss. Several times I've stared in disbelief at the amazing suggestions that it made, which were exactly what I was planning to code up next. Like you cannot believe if you've never used it\\n[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.639] how incredible these kinds of tools are.\\n[00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.720] Like you define, I know, a new field in the database\\n[00:08:26.720 --> 00:09:42.639] in your model somewhere, corresponding code directly into chatgpt4. And until now at least, I've always gotten a correct or mostly correct answer back that really helped me get on the way to a solution. This has increased my development speed by at least 5X, if not 10X time. I think Copilot and chatgpt turn every developer into a 10X developer, which kind of devalues\\n[00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.399] the 10X developer thing, but it was a meme anyhow.\\n[00:09:45.399 --> 00:11:04.580] Just saying, like these tools massively impact surprisingly complicated, the recording part has been more complicated than I thought. Capturing audio through the browser can be extremely difficult because different browsers in the implementation of the web audio AI, they just have completely different approaches to stuff. Some browsers are extremely protective of the user's microphone and you can't even check if you're allowed to use the microphone, which is a Firefox problem. Other\\n[00:11:04.580 --> 00:12:20.200] browsers, mostly Chrome, make this few images here or there, but with audio, it becomes more complicated. File size explodes and resource consumption does too. That has been an interesting challenge. But the goal is to make this product unique, right? In terms of how well it deals with this data.\\n[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.159] So it's just a technical challenge for me to overcome.\\n[00:12:22.840 --> 00:13:42.960] But I want it to be unique in improving both the capturing And that's transcription and summarization of audio. Because when it comes to managing audio data, having its content as searchable text and understanding what it's about at a glance, those are some things that are severely lacking from the voice messaging space right now. So I used what I have learned about GPU-based language\\n[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.639] models in the past, which in my case\\n[00:13:45.639 --> 00:15:01.320] was that you don't need a me to do it on a CPU alone, which is the kind of computer that sits in a rack in a data center somewhere. And I also built another service for summarization. Because like I said, I already knew how to do Whisper and OpenAI's transcription service, having built this before, simple,\\n[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.360] but summarization was something completely new.\\n[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.639] And I wanted a service to provide a one or two sentence\\n[00:15:05.639 --> 00:16:20.759] summary of any message that it on my computer. Whisper also exists as an API on OpenAI's platform, but it's perfectly fine to run it\\n[00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.759] locally.\\n[00:16:21.759 --> 00:17:44.319] I knew I could do this already, and I did. They've trained with between 7 billion and over 100 billion parameters, so their models vary in size and adequacy and accuracy, which that impacts the memory and execution time footprint of the models when you run them, as well as the file size. Then you add quantization to the mix and you have a very complicated AI system, but you have a complicated AI system that you can run easily and reliably on your own computer\\n[00:17:44.319 --> 00:19:00.480] through tools like llama.cpp, always run on the server forever for free. And that's crazy, because that is just a completely independent software system that does magic.\\n[00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:04.279] Well, I had to work on getting the prompt right, so that took me a bit,\\n[00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:07.400] and I ultimately experimented with a few different language models,\\n[00:19:07.400 --> 00:20:22.319] but this was working within hours. tech stack choice. And I know that will be interesting. A couple people will now start cheering, I guess, and several other people might start crying because for this project, I'm using the Laravel PHP framework, which opened my eyes to modern software engineering, because I didn't expect to ever find the framework this good. And honestly, had you asked me like a\\n[00:20:22.319 --> 00:23:01.599] couple years ago, I would have not expect to ever code in PHP again, because it's probably more interactive to the rise of frameworks like Angular. I was big in Angular 1 and Angular 2, and Vue and Svelte and React and all of these things. It's been amazing Should I look into it? I think I'm glad I did because Laravel, which is the brainchild of Taylor Hartwell and many others, it has something unique that I haven't seen much\\n[00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:04.920] in the JavaScript community or in other communities.\\n[00:23:04.920 --> 00:24:20.400] It has a very intentional ecosystem easy to use as plugins that automatically integrate into your system because they've been designed by the people who built the framework. And as a business owner and entrepreneur, I find this whole thing very interesting and the monetization side of it is the most interesting part. The Laravel team has built tools for server management, deployment that work well and\\n[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.200] integrate with stuff like external resources like AWS or Hetzena servers or Digital Ocean\\n[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.279] Troplets.\\n[00:24:26.279 --> 00:25:42.339] There's something called Laravel Forge that, which itself is an open source implementation of the Stripe and the Paddle API. So you don't need to buy Spark if you wanna have a billing backend. You can just use the open source version and just code it up yourself. But for a hundred bucks, you get all of this done using the same library you would have used anyway, but using it in a way that the people\\n[00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:44.400] who built the framework would have wanted to.\\n[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.759] It's really, really smart.\\n[00:25:45.759 --> 00:27:01.319] It's a great ecosystem of tools. and channels and widgets and landing pages, all the things needed for my voice messaging system. Figured out how to use Laravel's backend processes, they call them queues, to use FFmpeg for audio conversion, how then to call my Whisper CPP and llama CPP implementations to do the computation heavy AI work, and how to pull it all together.\\n[00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:04.559] I had to end up writing my own audio capture component\\n[00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.079] because I looked for open source ones\\n[00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:07.119] where you could just, you know,\\n[00:27:07.119 --> 00:28:22.319] like get a view component in there and record audio, found an ecosystem that has thought about all of this. So let's maybe look at the money right now. Obviously, I have zero customers not having launched this yet, but let's look at the economics of the business right now. Hosting costs me around $20 a month on the Hetzner cloud. I have a dedicated server there with 16 gigabytes of RAM, not too much, but just what I need to run my AI that I have\\n[00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:25.880] in the background there on a single worker queue.\\n[00:28:25.880 --> 00:29:41.599] If people send messages one by one, is a manageable challenge, right? Solar customers is 20 bucks a month. Premium customers is 50 bucks a month, which is quite cheap. I probably won't keep these prices that low, particularly because these podcasts that I'm aiming for at the higher tier, they are well monetized. So a tool like this can easily go into the hundreds. But let's keep it at 50 for now.\\n[00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.680] Beginner pricing, right?\\n[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.000] Not all features are fully complete.\\n[00:29:46.000 --> 00:31:01.440] Might as well give them kind of some savings. continue writing my newsletter and doing my podcast. I'll keep conducting interviews. Obviously, Podline will remain a side project, or rather, one of the many small bets that I'm making. But it is an exciting new feature for me, and a new venture for me to go on. And I can't wait to see where it goes. Let's see what we can create together,\\n[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.839] because that's what building in public is all about.\\n[00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:06.559] Now, I need a few deadlines.\\n[00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:07.400] That's how I work.\\n[00:31:07.400 --> 00:33:48.140] I want to make sure know, get on websites, get into existing landing pages, you know, integrate SAP or if this and that make these kinds of things to alert people when stuff happens. of interest just feel stuck in your business what to do, what is the story that everybody wants to hear is that you buckle down and did audience building marketing and sales outreach and you made all that money six months down the road because you really really dove into it triple your revenue everything is successful but.\\n[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.679] now. It doesn't have to be, but it's always good to be prepared just to check things out.\\n[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:55.599] Thank you for listening to the Boots of Founder today.

This episode is sponsored by Acquire.com. More on that later.\\n[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000] I was inspired by a clip from an interview with Rick Rubin this week.\\n[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000] And he discussed the notion that art should be created primarily for the artist's satisfaction,\\n[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000] placing the audience second. I think he even said that you should place the audience last.\\n[00:00:22.000 --> 00:01:43.420] I think the idea is that art truly resonates with others only when it authentically represents the creator's best effort. experience, and not just thinking about what they need, but also what could come of a relationship with them. The advent of AI in particular has led me to consider adversarial strategies in business, using tools and frameworks to challenge my ideas and sharpen my writing by looking at it almost from the perspective of an opponent, of an enemy, of somebody out there who wants\\n[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.879] other things that I want, whose interests are in conflict, in aggressive conflict with\\n[00:01:47.879 --> 00:03:03.360] my own. impact here. So now we need to expect business predators around every corner?\\n[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000] Well, of course not. I wouldn't go that far. Adversarial thinking, this kind of externalized negativity is valuable, but it's just as important to maintain the positive outlook and focus on creating meaningful contributions, like doing good stuff. Not just fearing the bad stuff, but doing good stuff too. I think this approach, and I'll go into detail in the second, is a pretty sharp blade of a tool. And it can cut both ways, quite literally.

So there are API rate limits and there are certain other limits in place\\n[00:04:25.000 --> 00:05:40.079] that tell me if there's sign up to my business. I put an email verification, for example. Like people get an email, they have to click it before they can use the product, which is great with Laravel, the PHP framework that I'm using that has it effectively built in. If you use Laravel's Jetstream,\\n[00:07:01.000 --> 00:08:20.959] the plug-in system that allows you to build authentication right out personal branding too. It's not just about building software, where it's pretty clear that there is technical abuse, but I don't just have a database to protect. Let's just say this. I have to manage my public persona and minimize potential backlash as well, because my personal platform, my presence on the I'm going to end with this, I guess. Here's an extremely practical tip. If you want to use adversarial thinking or use it as a part of your process, I just want to try it out and to understand what it is. I've been learning to use AI as this fictional enemy\\n[00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.279] to critique my writing.\\n[00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:23.800] It's been really helpful.\\n[00:08:23.800 --> 00:09:41.440] Like telling JetChippyT to take a draft of what I was writing I guess if we watch all the Terminator movies, you really know what that means, but take this literally at this point and maybe really just never ever take it figuratively and it will help you strengthen your writing. That means writing tweets, writing threads, writing articles, writing books, writing emails, anything. Like particularly emails.\\n[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.600] That's something where this is super useful,\\n[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.620] probably way you might not expect it\\n[00:09:45.620 --> 00:11:02.279] because emails are a very like human to human and adjust accordingly. I think this perspective is crucial for navigating this competitive landscape of entrepreneurship that we're all in, right? Where it is important to understand and then preemptively address the challenges posed by competitors and the market. This will significantly impact how quickly you find success.
