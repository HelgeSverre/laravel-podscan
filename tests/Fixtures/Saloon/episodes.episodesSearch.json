Even the least faithful generation in history had a man named Noah. Faith in God extends back to the days when Adam and Eve walked with him in the Garden of Eden. Our God is the God of the ages, and there have always been people who knew him and worshiped him as God.<\\\/p><p><br><\\\/p><p>Why then are there still people who don\\u2019t believe in God? He has kept his word, his covenant, with every generation in history, but he isn\\u2019t able to keep it with every person. A close look at Deuteronomy 7:9 reveals that God keeps his covenant and steadfast love \\u201cwith those who love him and keep his commandments.\\u201d<\\\/p><p><br><\\\/p><p>The best way to know and love God is to obey his word. Jesus said, \\u201cIf you love me, you will keep my commandments\\u201d (John 14:15). We learn to love the Lord by walking in obedience to his direction. We experience his thoughts, his voice, and his holy presence in our lives through his Spirit.<\\\/p><p><br><\\\/p><p>We know that the Lord our God is God when we experience his transforming power in our lives. It's the same power Moses experienced when God parted the Red Sea. It's the same power King David knew when he faced his enemies. It's the peace and comfort Paul experienced when he was imprisoned in Rome. It's the same love and presence John experienced on the island of Patmos. We know that the Lord our God is God in the same ways the faithful people of every generation have believed.<\\\/p><p><br><\\\/p><p>God has always kept his covenant, and his love has always been steadfast in the lives of those who keep his commandments. When you adjust your choices to obey God\\u2019s word, you experience his favor and presence in your life. That has been true for every generation\\u2014and always will be.<\\\/p><p><br><\\\/p><p>To know God is the beginning of wisdom.
